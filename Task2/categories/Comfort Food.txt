OK people. Let's face it. If it was called Cleveland Market, nobody would go. But throw in a trendy city's name and "Oh, it must be fantastic." After all Boston does have the Celtics. And they gave us Kristin and Jared. But can they pull off fast food. Yea, kinda sorta. It's nice to have a fast food option that is a "square meal." No burgers or fries. Roasted chicken, that holiday green bean casserole everyone loves but is too afraid to admit they eat it, mashed taters (gravy sucks ass though)...all pretty descent. We even tried the sirloin there, cooked medium rare, but WOW, it was like $12! So, I'm sure it's not even a Boston based company. And we all know it's nothing like a market. But three stars for dependable, un-bunned food! Oh. The cornbread? Seriously, it's "crack" good. I'd knock over school children just to get an extra one. As they say in Boston, "cheers." I know. Lame. Now, go get some cornbread!
Turkey dinner for 3 review

Pros:  The corn bread, green beans, and creamed spinach were delicious.  

Cons:  The turkey was dry, the gravy was uninspired, and the apple pie is almost unedible.  I will definitely try something else next time.
Comfort food... Basic down-home dinner. :-) sometimes ya just gotta.
I work just up the street and we always eat here for lunch, every time i go in they are always super nice and friendly, the food is fresh and I'm always in and out. Most of the time I'm picking up food for the whole office so one of the employees told me that i can call and order over the phone to make it easier on me which was great! I love going here, i always get GREAT service :)!
Got take out from here the other night and I enjoyed it :) I got the chicken breast with Mac and cheese as well as mashed potatoes. It came with a yummy piece of corn bread too. 

They have Sriracha by the bottle which every restaurant should have ;) 

The price was great and id recommend it to families or anyone just wanting a decent meal, either on the go or sitting down
So I have been there TWICE in the past week now im hooked! lol fresh clean ! Tasty! I love there Coke cups maket he soda taste just better! Service is great Chefs are friendly New fav place! lol = ] Enjoy guys!
Nice area and very public service friendly. The restaurant is clean, the staff are very kind and polite, and the sandwiches are rocking! Definitely a home cooked alternative to the fast food competitors. Service with a can do attitude and smile. This is one place that truly appreciates their customers.
I love my comfort food and Boston Market always fits the bill.  I have always loved the rotisserie chicken but on this trip I decided to try the Ribs.  Flavorful and tender they were good but were not served hot as expected.  It was almost like they were prepared, then chilled, then re-warmed up again.  One Quarter Rib plus One Quarter chicken plus two sides $12.99.
When I moved here 8 months ago, I was overwhelmed by the amount of places to eat.  I ended up trying numerous "trendy" offerings around the area, but always came back to Boston Market. It is now my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  So consistent in food quality and serving size and the employees are always outstanding. 

I never leave this place disappointed and I am always full!
Let's be real. Its Boston Market. They aren't reinventing the wheel.  But the food came out hot and fresh tasting. And the service was super friendly.  Theresa anticipated my needs and the line worked fast.  If anything, I'd come back here for the service and its clean. Those two things alone make it 4 stars when compared to other fast casuals.
I love Boston Market. I do not know how to cook and so the food there is always better than mine. The best part is if you buy a meal during the week they give you a coupon for one half off on Saturday.  Great value and it heats up well.
A good location. Everything here is always fresh, the line moves quickly, and the staff is always pleasant.
Have been craving boston market a lot lately. They have stellar originator chicken. Go here once evrey couple weeks. Staff is friendly, place is clean, food is tasty. Dont know what more I could ask for? Oh wait. Bring back the sirloin tips!!!!
I can't help it that I'm addicted to sweet potatoes. So that's why I have been gravitating toward Boston Market lately. My two sides are always sweet potatoes, or should I say my main course is the sweet potatoes and the chicken is my side. The food is excellent, although sometimes the chicken can get a little scrawny looking.

My only complaint about this place is that I'm constantly approached by employees to either sign up with my email address or being asked how's my meal. Last time I was in there I was asked how's my meal twice by the same guy and then a manager came by and asked the same thing. I get the touchy feely customer service thing. But PLEASE, dial it down a bit.
Get the honey habanero sauce with your chicken. Free, good mix of spicy and sweet and probably the best sauce for chicken ever.
I've eaten at several Boston Markets but this is the one closest to me. In my opinion, it's far superior to most fast food but it's nothing special.   It is good if you're too tired make dinner and want something fast and tasty.  The people at the counter are always very nice and helpful.  The side salad is actually pretty good and has more variety than your typical lettuce/carrot combo.  The mac and cheese and the creamed spinach are really good if you're not watching calories.
Back when my hubby & I moved into our first apartment together, we would pick up Boston at least once a month. After a couple years of doing so we got pretty burnt out on it & stopped going for a while. Last week the hubs suddenly got a craving for it, so we hit up the drive thru for dinner. We got the family meal for three & chose the chicken with mac & cheese, red potatoes & corn for our sides. It also comes with 4 pieces of cornbread. We got some dessert as well, a cookie & a brownie. Their chicken is pretty good, better than KFC but not as good as El Pollo Loco. Their sides are pretty good as well but very fattening. The cornbread is yummy, my hubby is a big fan. I had the cookie which was sweet & a bit crunchy, hubs had the brownie which was rich & very soft. Total for the family meal & desserts was about $26. A bit pricey, but we both had dinner & I believe my hubby squeezed two lunches out of it as well. I'm sure we'll be back eventually!
Been awhile since I've ate here but got a craving and stopped in.

The wait staff was prompt, courteous and looked like they genuinely enjoyed working there.  I was in and out in well less than 10 minutes.

The food, ordered to go, was really good.  We had the 3 person chicken dinner with sides of stuffing, corn, and red potatoes.  The meal comes with corn bread as well.  
Total with tax came to 23.28.    

Chicken was tender and tasted very fresh.  In fact it all tasted really good.  Obviously it is a well run restaurant for it's class.
I enjoyed my meal here. Very nice and friendly staff, courteous manager that was very attentive to the customers and his staff, and clean dining room. Lastly, we went at an off time (not during main meal hrs; 3 pm) and the food was fresh and not crusted like most others look like when they sit for awhile. Liked much.
We have been to this location a few times while shopping in the area and the food and service is always good. A couple of times there has been a bit of a line, but they move through them pretty quickly and are still friendly in the process.  The food is what you would expect from a typical Boston Market location - which isn't a bad thing, consistency is a good thing when you have a feel for what you are wanting to eat.

We have also used their locations for pre-packaged, re-heatable side dishes for holiday and such, which has always worked out well.

Overall: B+
Not a bad stop off for some instant food service with standard comfort dishes!
Ordered at drive through.  
1/4 Rack of Ribs NOTE: Was up sold to the 1/2 rack [Wish I had stayed with my plan for a 1/4 chicken] 
New Garlic Potatoes
Mac & Cheese
Choc Cake Slice
Large Coke Zero

Upon arriving home, picked up my drink, squeezed the plastic cup a bit to maintain grip of a large drink and the plastic cup split about half way down about an inch long. Soaked the interior of my truck, and my iPhone.

Okay stuff happens, but then the food!  

First time having the ribs.  Just awful flavor of the sauce, and the rib meat was just "off". Not sure how to explain it other than, your expecting pork ribs, but got beef maybe?  Not sure what these were. 

The new potatoes. Were a bit crunchy like they were under cooked. The plastic fork broke off in the first one. 

The bottom layer of the cake was dried out, and not moist like the rest of the cake. How old was this piece? 

The only thing good was the mac and cheese, and the corn bread.   

I would have expected a lot more for $18.83 of for a single meal.  I tossed it out without eating most of it. 

Boston Market is usually decent, but your way off your game today. Not a fan of your new menu items at all.  

Please stick to what your good at, chicken.

Follow up note: I did call the restaurant the evening this happened just to advise them about the cup issue. This was before I tried eating the food so they were unaware of the other issues. Couple days later I did get a call from corporate regarding the drink, and they were only concerned if I was making a claim against BM for the damages. I said no, I cleaned it up myself, I was only making a comment as they might have an issue with their cups.  But I did take a moment to comment about the meal, and was advised I'd get a follow up call.   That was several days ago.  Don't bother, I've already made up my mind about my future purchases with BM. They will be limited.
Amazing staff, really nice people. Good service and yummy foods!!! Had the pot pie, it was great. So many sides.
Always a savior on the holidays! Also, be sure to ask for the puppy treats if you have your dog in the car with you when you go through the drive-thru, since they'll sometimes have little dog biscuits for them!
Ahh.this is a great comfort food pick-up place. Every time it's cold and dreary or i'm sick and craving the foods my mother used to make, I know I can be in and out and back home in 15 minutes if I come here. 

I'm a chicken lover- this is one of my favorite places. I get secretly happy when I order the 3pc dark and they give me 2 thighs and a leg, instead of vice versa. As far as other meats go, I think the turkey is bland, but the meatloaf is tasty. The pot pie is good if you're extra hungry- it's huge!

There are a wide variety of side dishes- recently they added side salads to the mix, and they've had fruit cups for awhile. You can get all sorts of hot sides, from the standard mashed potatoes and vegetables to creamed spinach, cinnamon apples, and creamy mac and cheese. You get a cornbread with each meal that you can either cover in butter or wad up into a ball and throw at somebody.  

The wait times are small, even during peak dinner time when the line goes to the door. Service is always friendly, and they are quite generous with the portions. On two occasions i've had to wait an extra amount of time for my meal- without asking, I was offered a drink twice along with a dessert once. This is a good option for fast but satisfying food.
Best Boston Market I have been to. No question.

Boston is normally a 2-4 star price-performance selection in my book. This one is a solid 4. I bump this one up to a 5 (which I normally never give a franchise) because of spectacular service.

Score: I don't really score franchises by menu item. If it's a franchise - you probably like some items or you don't. Suffice it to say the half-chicken all dark and sides here are all solid 4 stars to me. Everything has been a 3+ here graded for Boston's expected quality.

Details: What makes this place a 5-star to me?

I rolled through here right after landing in town one day to grab some food for the Fam. Low and behold - they were out of everything I wanted. I arrived just between food-rotation shifts. Durn bad luck.

The lady running the place mentioned they still had extra of a few items I normally never sample at a Boston (like Meatloaf, and some sides I don't get). Asked if I wanted to try them and I said "no", and plus, I couldn't wait. So what does she do?

She hooked me up for FREE!. She had me try the meatloaf and something else....on the house. She even offered the sides on the house (I think they were changing them out anyway). I insisted on at least paying for the sides. I just can't justify taking food and not paying for some portion at a place I won't do regular business at. I hope this review doesn't get the manager in trouble.

Suffice it to say everything was great. My local family members go there often, and I look forward to heading back again next time I'm in Chandler.

Update: I have returned since I wrote this, and still found the service at this Boston's to be *excellent*
When I say I enjoy Boston Market people are like what... This is a one of a kind Boston Market the staff is always so friendly and will help you pick the best meal and joke around.  I always order the Quarter White Rotisserie Chicken with a side of Corn, Loaded Mashed Potatoes and Squash Casserole. The staff is so helpful they bring the food to what table you pick and are always around to fill your drink or get anything you need. The meal is always great and I can't get enough Squash Casserole so good...  I will be back soon for sure.
Never been to a Boston Market?  

They basically have roasted chicken and a variety of sides.  You go up to the front counter and choose what to eat - it's all laid out there in front for you to see.

Pay, sit down and eat.

I like roasted chicken - here, it's not too bad.  A little better flavor than your hot roasted chicken that you'd find at your supermarket.

The sides are pretty good, too.  Not great, it should hit the spot.

I'll never forget how one pecular employee at one particular location welcomed me as I walked into the door - he hollered "Welcome to BM!"  I won't tell you what type of grin I had while eating my lunch.
Employees here are always super friendly, even though this restaurant seems to have the worst customers I've ever seen. No joke, I visit this location every few months and every single time I have had a rude customer in front of me or behind me. If they aren't plowing me down to race me into the door then they are complaining about something or demanding something special (FOR FREE) because they are entitled jerks. Employees are always smiling and polite and patient, I really don't know how they do it. 

Service aside, the food is always fresh and tasty. I'm constantly seeing the sides being swapped out, even during slow times in the middle of the afternoon. I like knowing the food isn't just sitting there under heat lamps getting crusty. The meals are a great value, and they reheat nicely. Sometimes you have to remind them to give you your cornbread, but after seeing what they have to deal with at this location I definitely let them slide on that.
Love this place! Food is always great and fresh and tastes home made. The servers are always nice and make sure you are taken care of. It's a nice balance of a sit down and fast food, because it's healthy, but also fast. And you don't get bothered every 10 seconds by a server. The servers at Boston Market just come by every 10 minutes or so to make sure everything's good and then clean up after you (if they're not super busy) I highly recommend this place. The loaded mashed potatoes and the sweet potatoes are delish, and as for the sandwiches I get the Mediterranean carver.
The food isnt hot. How can they prevent bacteria from growing. T he inside smelled terrible
WOW - must be the new management. The service was the best I've seen in 12+ years I've visited this place. 
The food has always been good, service - not so much. 

Keep up the good service and be back more often :)
Yeah, yeah, I know, it's a chain.  But it was there for us when we needed it.  My mother wasn't eating well on her own and my middle daughter lived in Mesa, not too far, so she would stop by Boston Market and pick up a couple of dinners on the way to visit her and they would have a nice visit and meal together.  Since Mother always liked what my daughter brought and ate well, at least we knew she was getting good nutrition from it and some leftovers for the next day.  

When I was in town I would stop by there too  I always liked their sides and would sometimes just get a vegetarian plate of just the sides.  I liked their roast sirloin or whatever they call it too, for the price.  And their desserts were pretty good.  I liked that they had dishes that you don't find in most fast food places.  I never had a problem with anything I ate from there and they were pretty consistent in their quality so I give it four stars on a sliding scale compared to other fast food establishments.  I'd go back anytime I'm in the mood for good old American comfort food.
A little pricey, but worth it. It's typical to spend around $15 for 2 people, which for fast food is up there. Even though the Yelp pricer thing say, cheap? Turkey with corn and mash potatoes and mac n cheese. Mmmmm. I only with they still had the sirloin.
Top notch, caring staff. For what they serve, at all hours of the day, never a let down. I eat here whenever I need a cooking break now.
Thanksgiving happens to be my favorite holiday! But here is the problem with that... its once a year. I crave turkey and all the fixins alot more then once a year but there is no way in hell I am going to cook all of that. So that is where Boston Market comes into play. 
Boston Market has all the home cooked goodness of Thanksgiving but they serve individual meals so I can get that wonderful Thanksgiving comfort food experience at a fraction of the price. VICTORY! 
Their turkey and chicken are delicious but just like Thanksgiving day, what really stand out for me are the sides. I don't think I have had one thing at Boston Market that I didnt like. Among my favorites are the creamed spinich, mac and cheese, veggie stuffing, sweet potato casserole, and corn bread. 
Yes their prices are a bit higher then KFC but the quality and taste of their food is in on a whole other level. Also the service is always fast and friendly. 
If you love Thanksgiving and want to taste it, go to Boston Market today!
Quarter chicken white with garlic new potatoes and mixed vegis. I get that meal at least once a week. Chicken is always cooked perfect with great flavor. Chocolate chip cookies are great too!  Staff at Alma/Ray are always friendly and give you a great smile at the drive thru.
Just okay food...i had the meatloaf sandwich...which was decent. Never being here but it failed to wow me. The girl at the register should put on smile once on a while.....great customer service goes a long way. Other than that it seem to cater to big family brunch.
Everything's fine here... they do seem to run out of chicken at times so like dark meat they were out of on a few occasions. otherwise I go back often, drive-through is fast and accurate.
I have eaten at Boston Market more these past 6-months than ever before, no particular reason.  This past experience left me tasting, well bland meatloaf.  I was very disappointed, very bland, no spices, nada zip.  Oh well, maybe I should simply stick to the chicken!!
We ordered our Thanksgiving dinner from this location, knowing from previous meals that the food has always been tasty.  Well, Boston Market did not disappoint.  The food was delicious, the turkey moist, the mashed potatoes were homemade.  All I needed to do (besides heat it all up in the oven) was thicken the gravy and add some of the turkey drippings to it.  The ordering and pickup process was simple and organized.  Tip:  schedule your pickup first thing to avoid long lines later in the day.  We may order from them again for Christmas dinner!
I stopped by last Thursday after a lengthy absence. I don't mind the restaurant in general, but when my former roommate and I moved to Phoenix in 2004 we didn't know the town and we didn't immediately venture too far away from the apartment. She loved Boston Market and dinner what seemed like nightly was there. We kept going back because every time we visited we received a coupon on the receipt for a buy one get one free meal. When I was able to avoid going constantly I stopped and hadn't returned.

I am searching for a rental home in Chandler, and as I was driving by around lunch time I noticed the old Boston Market we used to visit - so I decided to stop. I ordered the meatloaf, and that is definitely one of the best. I would say the 1/2 chicken and the turkey would be my other main selections. The mac & cheese is excellent, and I chose the garlicky spinach for the second side. As a meal it comes with the entree, two sides, and a corn bread. About $8 without a drink and upon check out I received, you guessed it - a buy one get on free coupon. Those are only good for specific dates -  mine was for two days hence, but I am not in that area too much now I skipped it. The meal was excellent and maybe heightened in appreciation since I no longer have it daily.
This place is great, same as I remember it from years ago when I worked near here. Food is fantastic, prices are not bad, and did I mention the food is fantastic?!?!
I know it's a chain, but it's a good one. This location is always clean and the food is fresh. I've never had a bad meal. The chicken is good as is the turkey. Spiral Mac and cheese and mixed vegetables are my favorite sides, but they have many more to choose from. It's nice to have a close fast food option that doesn't include a burger or anything fried.
We went for dinner on June 5th. First time at Boston Market . Staff was friendly. It was clean and seemed very organized. Wide variety of food selections. Everything looked fresh. We had meatloaf and turkey breast dinners. Both were tasty and fresh. Mashed potatoes and apple cinnamon were our sides with cornbread.  Very reasonable priced under $30 for both meals and drinks. Enjoyed the food and will return. They had one person clearing the tables since they handle cleaning off all tables. I didnt see anyone spray cleaning the table while i was there. Hopefully they do that. I am assuming they do....  Nice location with good food and service.
During the work week I have to eat out for lunch quite a bit and I get tired of paying 10+ for lunch. I remembered hearing something about Boston Market having a $5 lunch special so I figured I would go check it out... Finally there is a place that has good, somewhat healthy and well priced lunches! Your choice of carver sandwich with soup/salad and a drink, they have soup and salad and I can't remember the others but it was a pretty nice selection. 

You pay more at McDonald's for a combo and this is way better! If you are out and about for lunch I would highly recommend going here. I'm sure most people have eaten here before so the food won't be a big surprise but the price is GREAT! This will definitely be a go to for me.
I haven't been to a Boston Market in ages. But went in there last month for a change of pace during a sorching hot day. I LOVE the Boston Market A/C at this location. 

I had the half chicken with the Sweet Potatoes and Tortilla soup and a soft drink for about $11. The food was phenomenal. The cashier even said the soup was bottomless, wow! The soup was great, one serving was enough for me. The chicken was cooked perfectly and delicious. And I always save the sweet potatoes with the creamy melted marshmellows for last as my pseudo dessert (hint - get the sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving).
Pretty decent for fast food.  I haven't been to one of these places in over 5 years.  They serve the typical thanksgiving type foods or comfort foods. It was late and right down the street from my house so I picked this over Taco Bell.    I had a slider meal.  It had 3 little sandwiches a side and a drink for 5 bucks.   I got two turkey and cheese and a meatloaf.  My side was spinach w/ gobs of cheese creamy unhealthiness.

The standout of the evening was the sign next to the register on the glass case.  It was worth 5 + stars

"We're happy to freshly toss your salad.  Just ask!"


I laughed and sent the pic to my firneds.  The sign alone makes this place worth the visit
I usually get the 3 piece dark combo which is delicious. But I have to say those chicken drumsticks and thighs come from the skinniest chickens on the face of the earth. A couple of nibbles on the thigh and you're basically down to the bone. 

I think Boston Market needs to feed those skinny chicken models a little bit more. For the $9.67 they charge for that meal, which includes a drink; I think Boston Market can do better and I'll just have to go elsewhere for my chicken fix until things improve.
I have been to several Boston Market locations and this one is my favorite. The lobby is always clean and the staff is friendly. Prices can be a bit high on some items but worth the money if you want a good homestyle cooked meal without doing all the work.
Our family has a love/ hate affair with Boston Market.

In the early years, Boston Market  was a hot property, as hot as Chipotle is now.  Back then, when it was know as Boston Chicken, the sight of those spinning chickens would make our mouths water.  

Then the dot com era burst and people didn't want to go out for something they could buy at their local grocery store.  And then, due to over expansion, Boston Market went bankrupt.

So now, if you are following along at home, this when McDonalds came in and bought the company and saved them.  I forget what state we were living in at the time, but it seemed that all the Boston Markets, but a few were closed over night.  

Today, we have a more upscale restaurant.  Not quite a wait-service place, but close.  You order, like always up front and someone will come by and deliver your meal to your table.  Nice!  They even have fancy napkins and everything.  How about those green tinted Coca-Cola glasses, eh? LOL

Where our family has a disconnect, is the more upscale price and somewhat diminished quantity; hence value for our money.  They've also change several standard menu items like stuffing and cream spinach for what benefit I cannot understand.  In retail, you don't fix things that aren't broken! 

The food is still good.  The service is even better and the menu is still mostly (with the above noted exceptions) unchanged.  It's just times have changed.  Fry's and every other supermarket offer a fully roasted chicken for $6.00, and those guys at Chipotle are growing exponentially.  And one of these days, the public is going to figure out that El Pollo Loco is just as good.

So, we don't come here as often as we would like.  It's just now, there are so many places in the crowded "I don't feel like cooking tonight dinner market."  Sorry!
There were bubbles of soap shining on the tops of my various side dishes so I couldn't even eat my lunch.
Food is mediocre at best. Everythings been sitting out way longer than it should. Lance the manager has a very fake attitude. Pretends to be nice to customers but clearly isn't a pleasent person. Constantly yelling at his employees as well. On top of the mediocre food, the prices are way too high. Got a chicken carver combo for $10. Not nearly worth that. Maybe $5. Also only one drink size? Worst business module I've ever heard of.
Boo hiss your TV dinners are less salty than your food fresh from this restaurant. Used to love Boston Chicken but it's declined too much.
Great place to go for the nights I don't want to cook! They always seem to have fresh food out and ready to go around dinner time. Love the creamed spinach and the rotisserie chicken as well as the meatloaf. If you don't want to cook and want some comfort food, stop by this Boston Market. Clean too!
Boston Market, is well, Boston Market.  But, I like it, and thier food is good, chain or no chain.  I really wanted to give this place 3.5 stars, but decided I would up them to four stars, since thier food tastes pretty good.

I went here for Thanksgiving dinner, and the service was wonderful.  People were friendly here, considering that they are stuck working on a holiday serving others thier holiday dinner.  Place was clean, but the Turkey was kind of dry.  BUT, it beats that over processed crap your going to get anywhere else.
Used to go to Boston Market a long time ago.  Loved the chicken and the cole slaw, so went in just for that.  Guess what?  They don't make cole slaw anymore.  So I won't be a customer anymore.  Just ok.
As far as Boston Markets go, this one isn't bad. It, along with most of the restaurants I've seen lately, has been nicely renovated. They also seem to have upped their customer service, in that after you place your order, they actually escort you to your table and bring you your food. Even though there are no dedicated waiters, the employees still do their best to come around and make sure you're doing well.

The food itself is delicious! The chicken is always juicy, and the sides are always plentiful and tasty as well. Personally, I flip flop between the creamed spinach, the mac and cheese, and sometimes the sweet potatoes if I'm feeling like a complete pig. 

The only drawback to this particular location for me is that there's no drive through. I know, I know...first world problems.  Other than that, you'll be sure to find great service, engaged employees, and most of all, great food!
The service was great at this location
The young girl helping me choose my dish was super helpful
She woo'd me into trying the new pork ribs
She was so cool and friendly that I trusted her opinion. I ended up getting the ribs with Mac and cheese and stuffing as both of my sides 
My evening meal was great and it all started with that warm, friendly recommendation from the customer service 
This location is pretty much like every Boston Market, inside and out as far as decor and menu
Yumzo!
Tasted like chicken, which is what I ordered so they have that going for them. Pretty decent food, nice staff at this location, quick and easy for lunch!
Fast, friendly, great service, clean, and the food was all right! It was what I expected. If I need a quick bite to eat, I will definitely come back here.
I was pleasantly surprised by this outing at Boston Market. A few years ago, I had eaten at this location and wasn't particularly wowed by the food or the service. But now, they have improved by leaps and bounds. They're really focusing on a more comfortable, cozy environment for patrons that wish to dine on their homey Americana style eats with a fast-food type efficiency.

After you place your order, the cashier will bring your food to your table. If you get your order to eat in, they will serve it on some white plates with silverware. The workers here are fast and efficient, and are friendly even in high traffic times. When they can, the staff will come around and ask if you need anything, and will clear your table for you. The service here has been better than at some sit-down full service restaurants I've been to!

They offer deals now which are great if you are dining with another person. For $20, you can get 2 individual meals, 2 drinks, and 2 desserts! Quite a lot of food for a decent price.
Not once, but twice, have I left this restaurant only to end up violently ill for 2 days following. If it happens once, ok, maybe it's a one-off, a fluke. But for it to happen twice? Nope. I'm done. Both times, my partner and I went, got identical sides, but I got chicken, she got meatloaf. She never got sick, so I'm guessing the meatloaf is safe. 

But both times I had chicken, which looked like it was cooked through, I ended up in the bathroom for 2 days straight with the worst case of food poisoning. Like I said, if it had only happened once, that's one thing. But to have an identical reaction twice in a row says that something isn't right.

I'm wondering how sanitary the rotisseries are that hold the chicken. I mean, they put raw chicken on, cook it, take it off, throw another raw chicken on the same skewer. I don't see a lot of safe food handling being done. 

Needless to say, I'm not going back. Ever. In fact the thought of eating rotisserie chicken makes my stomach turn. Thanks Boston Market.
I remember my parents taking me to boston market when I was a kid in California. There's just something about their comfort food that sits right in my belly. Always a good experience at this location in Tempe. Foods good. Always satisfied.
Boston Market... yum.  If you're in the mood for some home-style foods or in a hurry and want some comfort food, this is the place to go!  I especially like this location because they have the same menu with healthy options AND they'll make you up a fresh batch of something if they're running low or it's late and they ran out.  My roomie and I sometimes stopped here after our Lifetime Fitness nights. :)

See ya there!
I've been to this Boston Market at least three times now, once a coupla years ago on my last trip to Az when my daughter and I were looking for a fast place to grab a bite before a movie at the Tempe Cinema Theater and then I rediscovered it by Yelping the neighborhood for the same purpose a couple of weeks ago.  That time I grabbed a quick Rotisserie Chicken Plate, dark meat (my favorite), with sides of Rotisserie Chicken Noodle Soup (unlimited refills but I didn't have time to partake of that), cornbread, broccoli (gotta get my veggies in when possible), and sweet potatoes casserole.  Other than being a little salty, which concerns me for health reasons, and the casserole being pretty sweet, everything was delicious and I wished I hadn't had to rush thru it but didn't want to eat popcorn on an empty stomach.  It made mighty fine leftovers the next day, too.

I attempted to go back a week later to try the Turkey Plate but discovered after I parked that I had worn the wrong shorts with my money and cards in the other pair back at the motel.  By the time I drove back there it was too late for the movie so I just ate near my motel and called it a night.  

Last night I made sure I was properly financed and headed over to this Boston Market again.  As soon as I walked in I was  enveloped in wonderful aromas that made my mouth water.  I ordered the Turkey Plate with cornbread, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes for about $8 including tax.  Now, I'm a dark meat fan, but that turkey breast was so moist and tender and flavorful I was an instant fan.  I could cut it with a fork, no knife needed.  The only problem was for whatever reason, it wasn't hot, just sort of tepid, even borderline cool in spots.  Because I was hungry and headed for another movie across the street I didn't say anything because it tasted so good.  The spinach and mashed potatoes were hot, just not the meat.  

Later in the meal a worker walked by and asked how everything was so I politely let her know the everything was delicious accept the meat wasn't hot when served to me.  A man who may have been a manager overheard me and insisted on bringing me a fresh serving of turkey even tho I told him it wasn't necessary.  I ate most of it there because it was even better warm, and added the rest to my leftovers for lunch today.  Needless to say I was highly impressed with this level of customer service.

The only other issue I had was when I first sat down I found the chair to be quite loose and wiggly so I switched to the chair next to it.  When the same man mentioned earlier walked by I mentioned to him about the chair.  He tested it, agreed it was not acceptable, and immediately removed it from service, thanking me for letting him know.  Again, I was impressed by how quickly a customer's concerns we're responded to.

I'm actually looking forward to returning here to have some of their Beef Brisket and maybe more turkey and soup.
Good old American food
I've been to this location many times.  I like that the food is fast, but not fast food.  We call it "Thanksgiving for Lunch".  The service is good, although they can be annoying when walking the restaurant. 

They lose a half star for taking the salt off the table and hiding it up by the soda machines.  Don't try to be a salt nanny.  And a half star for being too forward (Constantly walking the dining area, and watch out for the frequent buyers club or whatever it is called - they just have a list in front of the register with your contact info sitting there for anyone to read/copy/steal).
About as good for you as fast food gets - I love their stuffing, green beans, and mashed potatoes. I usually stick with the chicken, but they also have meatloaf and pot pie. The corn bread sucks - its time they let it go!
Great for people who want food fast and are willing to give up poor quality, unhealthy ingredients and crappy customer service.

The food is fresh, yummy and affordable (personal favorite = pot pie) - it's clean and comfortable - and the people working there are incredibly, almost unbelievably, friendly and attentive. Kudos to the manager for creating an environment that is all too rare in the Valley.

I don't know if all Boston Markets are like this one, but this one is really good.
I like this place because compared to claim jumper, prices are more reasonable for a meatloaf dinner and quicker. and if you get on their email list, you'll get special offers. Great comfort food choices and friendly service.   But I wish they had a drive thru at this location since sometimes I have my kids with me and this is not my first choice if I have them with me.
I always feel like I am in a cafeteria when I'm at a Boston Market, but this one? It makes me feel like I'm in a cafeteria... a sanitarium cafeteria. The place was gross. Not sanitary. Food was old and gray. The place creeped me out. Big thumbs down
Went here with 2 co-workers. Not too busy of time of day. They gave us 2 meals. Obviously, we ordered 3. They actually tried to briefly argue that they gave us all our meals. Seriously? 3 sitting at the table with 2 meals. 2+2 equals.....? Food was good though.
This is actually a really good Boston Market if you ask me.

I have found the customer service to be excellent and well above my expectations on more than one occasion. One young gentleman named Trevor was very helpful and gave us some great information about catering for a special event one of the times we went. He checked in on us to see how the food was and cleared our table and made sure we had everything we needed. I was quite impressed!

The food is also always really good at Boston Market. The brownies are addictive! I love how the fountain coke always tastes really good here and better than it does at other quick restaurants. I also like their drink cups a lot!
Nice location. Food is good. I like getting the side meal when I can;t think of where to eat. My baby loves the mac and cheese here. Staff is nice. Store is clean.
Just went thru the drive thru. All I needed was some red potatoes to take to a family lunch. They told me it would be about 5 minutes. It was actually almost 10 but the manager personally walked out the potatoes to me, apologized, and gave me an order of brownies.  she said "please take these on us and enjoy them wherever you are headed to" AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE
This place is BAD..... they dont know how to cut up there meat well all of the meat has the extra fat and nastiness that you dont want to eat i would NEVER. Advise any of you to go here i dont want to go there again myself.
I have been dreaming of you. Oh Boston Market, since I have moved south, I have been looking back on our past with such fond memories.

I sometimes cry knowing we are so far away from each other... and oh how I long for your tender turkey breast.  Cornbread that just melts in your mouth, and even the vegetables are from some other planet of awesomeness.

MC Burger Taco Box just isn't doing it for me anymore. Last night, in a desperate act of "preparing dinner" avoidance, the family loaded up and headed over to a slightly mediocre eating establishment *cough*pandaexpress*cough* and not only were we hurried through the maze of fried, sauteed, and mono-saturated, we were yelled at by probably the smallest woman I have ever seen. There was no warm smiles, rotisserie chicken, or green bean casserole.  

I love you Boston Market, please move to Laveen, before I am battered and deep fried.

Best sides dishes of any of its competition and the chicken ain't half bad either.  They have changed their service to ceramic plates and metal siverware if you eat in.  The chicken has always been good and the sides great for a fast food environment.
Have been to this Boston Market with Friend's on 5 Different Occasion's and everytime we go there. All of our Side Order's are alway's COLD.

Cold Mashed Potatoe's, Cold Stuffing, etc, etc. And they serve you very, very Small Piece's of Chicken for the Price that they charge you. 
-$7.50 with Tax.

It's not worth it.

I have to admit the Food look's very seasoned and moist. 
But it's ALWAY'S COLD.

And they give you.....Small Piece's of Chicken. 

Sorry Gang, Save Your Money and Go Somewhere Else. 
Too Expensive for Small Piece's of Chicken and COLD FOOD.
oOoh been here once for dinner and about three times for lunch...it's really a great place for a quick and easy meal and it's not too fatty like other fast foods..and it's pretty cheap. 

I love their 3 piece dark meat rotisserie chicken that comes with a delicious cornbread (I'm usually not fond of cornbread) and two choices of sides. I've had the creamed spinach, corn, veggie mix, squash mix, roasted herb red potatoes and sweet yam which is my least favorite....the sweet yam casserole is just too sweet for my taste...so not a big fan of that one..other than that the other sides are pretty good. The meatloaf meal is also really good...two really good size slice of meatloaf also with a choice of two sides and a cornbread...2 bucks more expensive than the chicken but sometimes you want something besides chicken. heh

So for a quick easy cheap semi-healthy meal that does not consist of a hand full of grease (burgers, pizza, tacos of that sort..) then Boston Market is really a fantastic choice =)

Yummers!
I don't care what anybody says, Boston Market it good homecooked style food. The prices are a half step above cheap but, I'm always down for good food. 

I got the chicken salad sanwhich with a side of mac and cheese. And of course a large cup of minute maid. All very good. Ill be back. Heard they got good chicken.....
Great food and service! They will bring your food to your table if you dine in and the staff is very friendly especially the manager.  Be sure to try the half chicken meal and Mac and sweet potatoes.  Their buy one and get the second half off is an amazing deal.
I always think their food is too salty but we come here on occasion.  They now bring your order to you and the food is served on plastic, washable plates rather than the disposable ones.  I like the chicken but like I said it's just all on the salty side for me.
I don't care if it's "gourmet poor people food." I love it! Was convinced to do the BOGO chicken and rib meal special split between three people. Not a bad deal. Mashed potatoes and corn were my favorite. BBQ sauces and ribs are pretty boring. Chicken is the best.
This is not a place that I would normally go to but my brother said I'm craving it. What to do what to do this is been going on for a week so finally I said behind will eat at Boston market if you have ever been in jail this food could possibly be delicious For you but for all the rest of us on the outside this is slop if you like overcooked vegetables overcooked chicken covered in nasty Gravy this is the place for you all I can say is yuck not for me but if you like it eat it
We went for lunch and I just had to write a review.   We walked in, immediately greeted, told about their specials, got our food very quickly and sat down to eat.  So, our food was pretty good, we had chicken, ribs, loaded mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese,  and cornbread.   The cornbread was amazing, moist, and very delicious.  The chicken was equally tasty, actually everything was very good, except my only complaint was the ribs were lacking of actual meat, they aren't the hearty ribs I was expecing and they were luke warm.  However, what made me 5 star this visit was their outstanding customer service.   The staff made us feel welcome, were extremely pleasant, I just can't say enough about how nice we were treated, they get 5 stars just for that!  It's becoming more and more difficult these days to find somewhere to go where the employees actually give a hoot about customer service.  That alone will make us go back again and again.    My only other critique, would be that of the lady walking around the place with her cell phone attached to her head, I'm guessing she was the manager and she was also was sitting in the eating area set up with her briefcase and again on her cell phone.  I don't think it's entirely appropriate for that to be ok.  Isn't there an office she could have went into, or at the very least pick the furthest table/booth away from customers view as much as possible, just sort of unprofessional in our opinion.   All in all, we'll be back, glad they are still around.
Went to pick up dinner tonight at Boston Market, and received excellent service. Joey, one of the Boston Market employees, helped me pick out a low calorie meat entree and was very knowledgeable about their selection. Great service!!
In the sordid world of fast food chains Boston Market is like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, a hooker with a heart of gold. The store is clean, the food is good (and can be good for you) and the service is never lacking. 

This particular location wins points from me due to it's location. It just so happens to be right between my gym and my office, making any post-workout protein cravings a no brainer. 

The main dishes are always consistent. I usually opt for the turkey, but the other meats are well prepared as well. The sides can be hit or miss, depending on how long they've been out or who prepared them. Typically the simpler the side the harder it is to screw up. Go green beans! 

The service is friendly and efficient. Usually my food is done by the time I've gotten my drink. You can't really go wrong with that speed. 

If I ever need to gnaw on a hunk of meat after a gym session Boston Market will continue to be my spot.
The first time i have ever been to this Boston Market. They greet you nicely when you walk in. The restaurant is very clean.....Lots of different food cooked and in stock. Smelled wonderful in there. I got the chicken pot pie, roasted chicken, green beans and mash w gravy. As well as the lemon spinach and corn bread.  Tasted a little of every thing  and everything was wonderful. Love it!
Turkey and chicken is good.

Everything else taste like hospital food at best depending on how long its been sitting.
This is actually kind of sad. The customer service here is very good. Food was served quickly and tasted fine. Here's my problem. I ordered a 3 pc meal. What I got was two pieces of chicken (leg & thigh) and the one thigh had been cut into two pieces. No, really, I'm not kidding! (see photo) WTF? Are you kidding me. Then, once you get to your table and sit down, you realize the Salt Police have left a note insinuating that your eating too much Sodium and you need some extra exercise if you want the salt shaker because you have to get back up and go get one. COME ON GUYS! For a $10 meal I want 3 REAL pieces of chicken and a salt shaker! Ugh!
The chicken and Mac and cheese are great
I go there for lunch at least twice a week I Love this place, and their new Select Chicken Sandwiches, very juicy. Very clean, and fast service. Really good costumer service. The older lady that's there at nights is very generous and is always attentive to the costumers wants.
The staff does a pretty good job and were friendly.  The manager was a bit standoffish and could be more welcoming.  The problem is the food is TERRIBLE.  The ribs are frankly, tasteless and the texture is strange.  The chicken is also tasteless although it was cooked well.  The brisket and meatloaf are also bland and seemed like they had been sitting for hours.  Very disappointing since I spent $80.00 for a mini-buffet.  All of the sauces, meats and most of the sides have the same tasteless flavor, or lack thereof.  The only food that was somewhat okay was the sweet potatoes.  Skip this place for any kind of meal.
I frequent this location before work quite a bit since I start work right around the normal dinner time. Always clean, friendly, and good food. They have real silverware and "real" plastic plates! Lol.
I have been to this location a few times before work and they're quick!!  Prior to this, I hadn't been to a Boston Market in years!  The last time I was there, they had plastic forks and knives and plastic plates that was sectioned off for your food. Now...real silverware and real plates!!   Nice!  :)
I love that they offer bowls now too. They are the perfect size and you can get anything you want in it!  Hmmm.  All this talking is making me want to go now!!
Having the Mediterranean chicken salad for the first time.  Not very Mediterranean, but i like it and it's enough for two.  This is a nice store, in a nice area, with nice people.  The real deal is if you go in on a week night, you get a coupon good for the weekend, buy a meal and a 32 oz drink, get a 2nd entree free.  So turkey lunch, salad dinner, for around $10.

I like that you can eat healthy here. I'd like to know how they get the turkey so moist.  I get the turkey because of that, even though i would rather have the chicken (all dark, too much fat!).  You can get chicken noodle soup as a side, and I like the green beans (i like sweet potato but it's a bit too sweet, which is only bad because of the added calories).  and corn bread for desert.
What happened Boston Market?  You used to have a nice nutritious meal at a great price point. Now, portions are very skimpy, veggies are limp, turkey is full of gristle and, worst of all your gravy is horribly watered down. Still a notch above other fast food but, what happened?  C'mon, you can tell us.
I stopped in for dinner Sunday night because I wanted something fresh and healthy.

I sure was happy I chose to visit an old favorite. I actually have been eating at Boston Market for many years, We would go to the valleys original location in Tempe, and back then it was a great place. Over the years I saw the quality fade and the flavors go south. I chalked that up to growth and just chose other dining options.

On last nights visit I was greeted by a friendly young lady who had that great "we are happy you are here" smile. I was happy that she helped guide me through side selections so I could get a side salad and fresh steamed veggies with The Half Chicken Special.

After ordering I noticed that the drink and condiment station was well stocked and clean, as was the dining room. I found a table and within seconds my meal was brought to me by the same friendly cashier. 

The meal was Hot and smelled delicious, The steamed veggies were cooked perfect and on the same quality level as most high end restaurants in this town. The side Caesar salad was fresh and yummy and at no extra cost! WOW! The Star of the night though was the perfectly cooked and seasoned chicken. I was so impressed with the plates and utensils because the were real. No plastic and paper, that was a nice touch.

Places like this have teams of executives that work hard to make sure there unit teams perform and execute meals and guest satisfaction like I had last night. Well somebody's doing there job and THAT'S FRESH!!!!

I recommend Boston Market if you have never been or haven't been in a while. It has to be the best meal in town under 10 bucks!
It's Boston Market. Same great taste and service like the others. Quick drive thru too.
We had planned to go to the Rio's Seafood Buffet however they were closed for remodeling until Mar 2008.  My brother recommended Hush Puppy.  We had the best all you can eat Crab legs you can get.  We had been to Alaska last year and the crab was just as sweet.  This place is  a large hole in the wall and  many of the local
 people show up and eat here (good sign)  All you can eat catfish was also good and the price wasn't  high.  I will go again but check ahead of time see which day they will be serving the all you can eat crab.  Other fixings ok but you are going for the crab.  Ribs not that good but why order ribs here anyway.  My Mom had Salmon said it was light and good.  We went to the one on Carleston (15 minutes from strip). Also have drive thru.
Wow...this place will sure make your puppy go..goo goo ga ga

Love the food....all u can eat salad bar, great quality & quantity juicy snow crab, scrumptious fried oyster, and flavorful ribs with meat fallin' off the bone.  The menu changes daily like all you can eat crab on monday etc.  Your belly will sure be satisfied and stuffed....just plain yum.  

If you're feelin' adventurous...try alligator or frog.  Maybe on my next trip.

The decor is southern meet bamboo country style.  Your server is very friendly.  Did I also mention...very reasonable pricing.

Whenever you're bored.....of course you're in Vegas so hit the slots inside the restaurant.

I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas!
This place been around for ... darn many years.
I only went there for Monday night All-you-can-eat-king-crab-legs-special :)

Monday plan is:
1. Light breakfast
2. Veeeerry light lunch
3. 5PM - get to Hush Puppy
4. Munch on their excellent Cole Slaw and Hush Puppies
5. Plate of crab legs - Plate of crab legs- Plate of crab legs ..... Plate of crab legs ... no I can't eat anymore ... plate of crab legs.
6. Loosen up belt buckle
7. Wash your crab stinky hands
8. Stop by Big Dogs brewery right down the street and have a microbrew ... repeat if you can.
9. Skip breakfast and lunch next day :)

You can order from the menu of course ... but we never really bothered. 

Bottom line: for how much crab we ate this place was probably taking loss on us :). Forget casino seafood buffet - concentrate on the good stuff.
a little inattentive forgot our fries & slaw but kept the crab legs coming-very friendly
all-u-can-eat crab what more do you need!! hot-fresh & oh so tasty!!
everything is good here!! didn't get any salad, fries or cole slaw
any place that has all-u-can-eat crab is alright by me!!
only $24.95 per person every monday night!!
usually much better service
The Hush Puppy has a sad looking dog on the front of their restaurant which I think is appropriate, I felt like that puppy looks when I left the restaurant last night. I met my girlfriend and her mom there for mom's birthday last night (Happy Birthday!!) as they like the Thursday night all you can eat seafood special. I've been suspicious of the Hush Puppy for several reasons, shady area, "southern food" in Nevada, and most telling a never quite full parking lot when I go by. Still I gave it a shot because there are plausible reasons why a good or even great restaurant my experience any one if not all of these things. Unfortunately that wasn't the case as I saw it last night. 

The restaurant it's self has been at this location for many years and it's age is showing; faded paint, outdated fixtures and furniture, it almost had a depressing feel to be honest. 

We waited a few minutes at the register as there was no hostess or sign inviting us to seat ourselves. Not a big deal but as the place wasn't that busy I questioned why we had to wait at all. We placed a drink order straight away and were told to help ourselves to the salad bar and hush puppies at the table. The salad bar was marginal at best, few topping options and the cherry tomato's were a bit old but not too bad. I did like the coleslaw. The hush puppies at the table were not at all what I had expected, about the size of a my little finger and oval in shape they had no flavor and I quickly put them to the side; I've had some delightful hush puppies in the past with chopped onions and seasoning. 

Fortunately we didn't have to wait too long for our meal to arrive, the all you can eat seafood included fried butterfly shrimp, cocktail shrimp, clam strips, deep fried oysters, and fried catfish (really seafood?) with a side of french fries I nibbled but left to the side as to focus on the seafood. With the exception of the clam strips which I found tough and gamy I liked everything on the plate. While surprised having catfish in a seafood special it was good, I liked the butterfly shrimp the best. The food as definitely the best part of my experience which is why I gave it two stars. 

I was very disappointed at the service, there were maybe four tables in our section, not an overwhelming prospect for a waitress I would think yet ours spent more time in the kitchen. My water was empty shortly after our plates arrived and I didn't get a refill for nearly 10 minutes, unacceptable. 

If you must have "southern cooking" in Las Vegas and have nowhere else to go I suppose you could give them a try as other guests have given favorable reviews but I wouldn't recommend it. I certainly won't be going back on my own.
First, this is by no means a "seafood" restaurant.  It's not the restaurant's fault that someone put it in that category.  Just the same, if you go to this restaurant looking for fish that come from the sea, you'll be highly disappointed. 

This restaurant has Louisiana style food.  I had an alligator/frog leg combo for about $12.95.  The portions were fair, and the alligator was as good as any I had while briefly living in Louisiana.  It came with a basket full of hushpuppies, and they were good.  The salad bar was included, with cole slaw the star of the show there.  My wife had blackened catfish with a baked potato and broccoli.  She's a little weird (maybe not weird, physically fit?) and complains about the butter flavor on the broccoli.  That's a plus in my book.  I tasted some of her dish, and I'd say it was just "okay".  She had ample portions, so if you want to be full on a catfish meal for about $12.50, this may be your place.

For the superhungry, they do offer "all you can eat" deals.
As you might suspect The Hush Puppy on Nellis Blvd has been around for a LONG time. How can I attest to that fact? I vividly remember having a temper tantrum as a child (probably 5 years old) near the salad bar. Rolling around on the floor tantrum, as in my mother spanked me in public tantrum (hello 80s!). Anyway, I am now 27 years old and have been to The Hush Puppy on numerous occasions. 

Basically this is a southern-style fish restaurant. A majority of the seafood (and alligator) are fried. Fried clam strips, fried shrimp, fried catfish, etc. If you're looking for more of the "grilled" fresh from the sea type stuff you are going to the wrong place. I've tried just about everything here, but my faves are definitely the all you can eat crab legs, the catfish, and the clam strips. I friggin love clam strips, I don't know why, but I do. ALSO - don't forget the hush puppies here. I personally think they could use a bit more flavor, but when you put their sweet butter on them they turn into delectable little treats. The salad bar is meager at best, but I doubt you're really coming here to fill up on salad.

As for the ambiance - service can be hit or miss. I know I've come here with my family before and been just irritated with the lackluster service, but then other times when the service was great. Unfortunately I think that just comes with the territory of the place. It is not fine dining, so the servers are just going to be a draw for ya.

I assume some people would be turned off by the location, it is a bit desolate, but most of the time when the place is hopping the parking lot is full. It's old, yes. But it's a great place to get your fishy/southern munch on.
The fried catfish here is so good. I wish they would bring back the all you can crab legs on Monday.
I grew up in Texas and spent some time in Louisiana and this place really brings back childhood memories. It features southern cooking which means just about everything is either fried or cooked in bacon fat. The food is really tasty, but this place is NOT for the health conscious. I had the fried alligator and collard greens which were just as goods those I use to get in Louisiana. The salad bar has an ok selection, but they need pickled okra to make the southern feeling complete. 

We came in with a fairly large party, about 7 of us in all and our server was fun and efficient. Our glasses were never empty and she made sure we were never wanting for hush puppies with sweetened butter.
This place has some of the best catfish in Las Vegas.  You can eat in or go through the drive through although the menus vary a little.  There is more variety inside and you can eat the salad bar.  The catfish is battered in a cornmeal batter.  I recommend the fried oysters although on my latest visit I was a little disappointed that they price of (6) had gone from $3.99 to $4.99 I assume because of hurricanes, flooding, or drought.   I am happy to report that over the years they have greatly improved the fries and they are very good.  The fried shrimp is passable, but are breaded before begin frozen.  The hush puppies are always great although better when eating inside since I always forget to ask for a side of honey butter which is free inside, but  costs money for take-out.  Another reason to eat inside is you can get the all you can eat specials or the standard catfish deal.

Additional compliment:  Their fries have greatly improved over the years.  They used to be the worst, but now they are pretty awesome.  They are perhaps the best French fries in Las Vegas.  I like them better than any fast food fries.
I've been to this restaurant several years ago and I went again last night with my girlfriend and dad.  We had to wait a few minutes because the place was slammed with customers.  Truthfully...there are only two waiters a dishwasher and the cook so if you order it may be awhile especially if you go between 5 and 7 pm.

Besides that the food is southern fried and the catfish is is the bomb.  I didn't like the shrimp too much it tasted a little different.  The tea is super sweet just I like it.  There's not much to choose from on the salad bar but it will hold you over till the main course gets there.  Give it a try!
The food was mediocre.  Husband ordered a combination platter specifically to get some gator.  He received his plate with no gator.  When he questioned where his gator was, he was told that they were out of gator.  Um, hello? Why wouldn't they inform him of that when he ordered it?  The manager said that they wouldn't be getting any gator until the end of the month (this was mid-month) so it's not like they suddenly ran out.  Our waitress was nice but so new that every time we asked a question, she had to leave us to go find out the answer.  Made for very slow service.
This place was pretty disgusting. The only thing I could recommend is the gumbo, Other than that the food was bad. The shrimp was probably Tyson brand, at least it taste like it. My sis asked for fried chicken, waitress said they don't have the ability to do any frying. The waitress then offered chicken tenders, she brought out but we later thought, if they don't do any frying,how are the tenders, fries, shrimp and fish fried? Could've been all microwaved. Everything was cold. I would not recommend this place to the homeless....
I love, love, love this place!  I don't know if I was there on a good day!  But when I don't feel like cooking my own, guess where I will be?  I'm waiting for you to guess?  Yep...DING DING DING! Hush Puppy!  
They aren't afraide to put there foot in there cooking (for those that don't  know, that's a good thing)  Yes, the seasoning on this fish was amazing, I love mine fried hard!  The salad was good, the Baked potatoe, was good!  I just wish they had pepsi products!  lol,
If your ever in the area, stop and check it out.  I know there's another one on Chareston, but I havent been to that one.
I've routinely visited this location whenever I've visited Vegas, but I'm seriously thinking I won't return. 

My last visit -last week- found poor service and poorer quality of food. After being seated the waitress took our drink order and didn't return for almost ten minutes, and only because we asked the hostess for help.

 I ordered the AYCE catfish and can honestly say the fish was awful!  

The texture of the fish was dry and crumbly, no moistness anywhere. It seems to me they've taken catfish fillets, cut them in half then deep fried until every piece of that fish becomes dusty crumbs. 

My niece had the boiled shrimp which didn't disappoint, but I can get shrimp anywhere. I wanted my catfish and I wanted it to be edible and tasty. Is that too much to ask?
First of all the company is writing their positive reviews. Everyone that was eating there was miserable. To start off my experience let me tell you that there was hair between the clear plastic on the menu and the paper. It was disgusting. I ignored this and ordered food. Huge mistake! The all u can eat is not feasible when your food takes 30 minutes per plate. The catfish arrived, and I don't expect much from catfish, it's just that the fish they brought was terrible. I took one bite, it was the worst thing I have ever eaten. While there I ate 6 shrimp and a few clam strips. Overall we saw our waitress twice and she never came back to ask if we wanted more. PLease never eat there, it is a horrid experience. Go to Long John Silvers before you go here. The place is not clean, the food is horrendous and the service is absent. If anyone rates the place as decent they are crazy or simple. No BS I hate Long John Silvers and this place is way worse. It's not homely like many southern fish joints, it's dirty and gross. I am from NC and have eaten at many disgusting fish camps and this place is beyond a joke. There is no hole in the wall appeal here. This place needs to be shutdown and those who continue to believe the reviews written by the restaurant are in for a terrible treat. I now have to go because my stomach is very upset from the dreadful salad bar.
Ive been a million times to this fish shack. But this last time really takes the cake. How about I tell you all about the old salad they display. OMG its old but you just happen to open 30 minutes ago. How on earth do you place old food out when you just opened? I got the all you can eat catfish and omg they didn't clean it right nor did they wash the fish in vinegar its smelled like something just died. Ewww!
The baked potato was hard and not done. The cup I was given to drink out of was dirty. And the restroom looked so dirty I walked in and said no way ...I mean that if I was homeless I would not use that restroom.
 It makes you ponder if the food is like that. And the restroom is dirty what does the kitchen look like? It made my belly hurt just to think of the nastyness that very well could be in that kitchen. We was only customer number 6 so they have no excuse as to why everything is dirty and nasty. I will never return. I looked over at my husband while at the dinner table and I said to him get full because we will never come back here ever in life.
My family and I visited this place yesterday to celebrate a birthday.  Let me tell you that it was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  The fish was horrible and the shrimp taste like it came straight from the freezer section of the local grocery store...actually that's giving them too much credit, because I've had frozen food from the market and it taste 110% better. Not only was the food inedible, but the entire restaurant had a strange smell...that should have been our first clue.  A couple of people in our group had the Gumbo and I wouldn't recommend that dish either.  My son had something as simple as a hamburger, and that was just barely edible. Everyone had stomach issues immediately after leaving the restaurant.  We are all from Los Angeles and have had our share of good fried fish all over LA, so we know good food. All I can say is don't do it, unless you like giving your money away. Let me make one thing clear, they are only receiving 1 star, because I don't believe have any other choice to select lower than 1.
This is my family's go to place for a quick dinner. The food is SO delicious, and since I live right around the comer and there is a drive through it is so convenient.
First off, I do not work for the company. Secondly, I have only been there once. My husband & I went here with friends who winter in Vegas, on our recent visit there. Yes, it's "divey" and could use some updating. The salad bar was fresh, and I can tell salad that isn't. Very good macaroni salad. Husband and I had the all you could eat catfish and it was phenomenal. It had a real cornmeal coating, not some stupid "batter". It was moist and tender and quite flavorful. I mostly like the fact they were boneless fillets; around here all you get is a slab of half a fish you have to pick off the bones. Tartar sauce seems to  be homemade. Service was prompt and friendly...a server who has worked there for years and knows our friends. I had the collard greens as my side (felt I'd been eating far too many freid foods and carbs on our trip) and they were amazing. And I know collard greens from my best friend. Lastly, it was a Saturday night and they were very busy when we left...the place was full of people who seemed to know what good southern-fried fish and the extras ARE. Try the jalapeno hush puppies if you think the originals are too bland. Price was fantastic...less than $60 for four adults. Where can you say THAT in Vegas?
Awesome spot for some good fried catfish, hush puppies and greens. The gumbo my husband had he said it was delicious.  If your ever in Vegas make sure you stop by and check out hush puppy restaurant.
So one night we craved for some catfish & raw oysters. (Okay, okay..no hankie-pankie here, we were just HUNGRY) What's the best place to grab one? Couldn't think of anywhere else besides Hush Puppies. 

Nice big, bright sign by the street, you won't miss it. We opted for the drive thru coz the kids were fast asleep in the backseat. Although there was a little mixed up in our order, they were very apologetic about it &  was fast in resolving the issue. 

The catfish came steaming hot & the oysters were fresh. Nyum!! Happy tummy here!!! Customer service was impeccable. 

PRO: food, customer service
CON: waiting time

Coming back & would definitely recommend.
This is the best place to get southern fried catfish is Las Vegas.  The fish is fried to perfection and is light and tasty.  Not to mention the affordable all you can eat catfish special. The salad bar is simple and traditional. Great pasta, macaroni and potato salad. Also the homemade tartar sauce is delicious, thick and creamy.  Fried alligator at most places it's tough and rubbery but NOT at The Hush Puppy. The alligator is tender and flavorful.

The only thing preventing it form being 5 stars is the hours and the all you can eat catfish.  Don't get me wrong, I ALWAYS order the all you can eat catfish, my issue is you have to really stay on the waiters and waitresses to get "all you can eat". After your initial order they ask you if you want more, but they bring you one or two pieces, then after that they sometimes push the check on you. I understand they maybe trying to keep costs down, but if you offer all you can eat, then expect people are going to eat a lot and be available to bring them plenty of fish.  Lastly the hours.  I'm a big lunch person and I only eat at this restaurant on Sundays, when they are open at noon. I understand mom and pop businesses are limited, but I really think they can increase profit by being open at noon the rest of the week, or at least on Saturday.
Don't let the location or the look of the place fool you.  The Hush Puppy has good southern food, offering some items that you won't find much of in the valley--such as alligator.

The atmosphere is very casual, certainly perfect for a family with kids.  The waitress was good; we did go a bit without seeing her at one point, but nothing enough to get us upset.

The food was really, really good.  

Appetizers:  First, we started with a bowl of gumbo, and it was fantastic.  My daughter ended up ordering another bowl as her main course.  The hushpuppies, which came with our meals, were good.  My wife liked them more than I; but I must say the sweet butter it comes with really enhances the flavor.  We also had the salad bar, which was very basic overall---and no complaints from us. 

Entrees:  My wife had the crab legs, which made her happy.  My son ordered the endless fried shrimp, and had the wharf combo--alligator & frog legs w/ greens.  Personally, I was happy with everything.  The batter they used didn't take away from the flavor of the actual food; the same went for the shrimp.  

So that's (for 4 people) - 2 bowls of gumbo, 3 salad bars, hush puppies for all. endless shimp w/ fries, over a LB of snow crabs w/ fries, alligator/frog legs combo w/ collard greens, and 4 drinks for under $80.  How can you go wrong w/ that?

And if you want to pick food up on your way home from work, they have a drive-thru!
I ate at The Hush Puppy at the Nellis location on 7-12-2014.  You need to check their site for when they are open.  Usually, after 5pm except Sundays (Noon).  I arrived a  little before 6pm on Saturday and the place had surprising more people than  I would have expected.  I was greeted cheerfully, immediately seated, after being asked my choice of table and area.  I was impressed with their friendliness and was given a menu, and the server returned immediately with a bowl of hush puppies and a sauce.  I ordered the $14.99 Platter that listed (4 to 5 small pieces) of alligator,(8 small on a stick) grilled shrimp,(6) fried clams, (2) fish fillets, and French fries (or baked potato).  I was told to help myself to the Salad Bar.  The plates were kept in a cooler and were  chilled.  The salad bar was small but more than adequate to make a salad.   I chose potato salad, pickled tomato's, a  lettuce/romaine combination, cherry tomato's, black olives, with 5 or 6 dressing options.  There were several other selections, but  my plate was full and I went to enjoyed my salad.  I ordered a draft beer and it came in a chilled mug and hit the spot.  Before I finished my beer, my order came. Everyone seemed to be getting their order about the same time and the server staff was busy.  I was ready for another beer when a man (the manager/owner ?) came around and ask if I needed anything and immediately returned with another chilled mug.  Several other customers also, were ready for drinks and it appeared that everyone had come about the same time and the servers were getting behind in refilling/getting drinks.  The alligator was not as seasoned as I would have liked and I was not impressed with it.  The fish was very good, cooked properly, crunchy on the outside and properly moist (I do not like undercooked fish) on the inside.  The fried clams made my dish.  They were very flavorful, crunchy and delicious.  I wish I had just ordered fried clams, they were excellent.  The fries were mediocre and could have been coated in a "Cajun" mix and would have helped the dish.  There was a lot of laughter in the restaurant, by customers and they seemed to be enjoying themselves.  There was no music and it would have added to the atmosphere of the place.  All in all, I would recommend giving this place a try.
Great addition to the neighborhood.  Wonderful (homemade) soup & quiche specials every day, tasty salads, and hearty sandwiches.  The space is well done and it's also a breeze to get take-out.  I get lunch from Manna at least once/week.  My only complaint?  Sometimes their portions are a bit stingy but maybe I'm just being greedy!
Located in a modest mini-mall on Madison's east side, Manna is a hidden find for anyone craving cafe-style breakfast and brunch.  Choose from omelette and egg dishes, pancakes, quiche, baked goods, or a number of other items.  Order at the counter and find a seat, but be prepared to hover and attack a table amongst the weekend masses.  A tip: there are multiple cash registers, so don't get stuck waiting in the (usually longest) line near the door.
Since the last Ovens of Brittany closed in 2000, my wife and I have been searching for a place to get morning buns.  Needless to say, we were delighted when we discovered that Manna Cafe's sticky buns look and taste just like Ovens' morning buns!  Simply heavenly.  Their muffins, especially the berry streusel, have also become a favorite of ours.  If you're dining in, you'll find their baked goods nicely complemented by a bottomless cup of Johnson Brothers' coffee.
I loved the decor of this place. It looked as if the place was newly renovated recently. Inside, the atmosphere is warm and welcoming with charming wall arts surrounding the dining area. The breakfast menu seem to focus on eggs. There are a lot of options to choose from their 3 eggs scrambles (yes, there are vegetarian option, too). My friend and I went there for Sunday brunch, and the place was pretty packed, and the service was bit slow. The food itself was not that impressive despite of the big tease on the menu. It wasn't bad, but just the average. I prefer the omelets at Sophia's bakery. The baked goods in the glass case looked very tempting. Perhaps on the next try.
When the boyfriend and I decided to take a road trip to Madison to accompany (read: chauffeur) his sister to check out a possible grad school, my first thought was, "where are we going to eat?" Manna looked adorable, so we included it on our route.

Manna is very cute. Homey, but not too country, with a decent sized seating area and a cozier room in the back with some armchairs and also tables to eat at.  The menu is really big for a bakery-cafe type place, almost too big, as I found myself ordering without really perusing all the options.  It was cold and rainy out, so I went with a cup of the tortilla soup and the Badger Special, or something like that- basically grilled cheese and tomato. I had a few issues, namely that the 'tortilla soup' wasn't really tortilla soup at all, or at least not like any tortilla soup I've ever had.  It was very chunky, and, well, there were no tortillas in it. It tasted good, but was too chunky to dip my grilled cheese into. And isn't that the whole point? The sandwich was good, but I always forget that while grilled cheese with tomato sounds like a good idea, in reality it doesn't work.  The tomatoes get all mushy and bland, and prevent the cheese from forming that perfect melty seal. Again, I really have only myself to blame. When will I learn?

The boyfriend and boyfriend's sister both seemed to enjoy their sandwiches, as well as the other soup option- creamy potato with cheddar. I tasted a bit, it was awesome. I was sad. 

If, for some reason, i ever find myself in Madison again, I'll probably try to make a stop at Manna to try some other delicious-sounding sandwich.  I'm guessing this will only happen if the sister decides on UW. Go Badgers?
Manna Cafe is a real gem!
we need a place like this in Austin.
the food is of excellent quality as is the coffee. in my experience, its hard to find a place that does both well.
We were at Manna for breakfast. We had the famous oatmeal pancakes with bacon, and eggs scrambled with veggies, that came with fresh fruit and  multigrain toast. The food was simply delicious and well done.
also, Johnson Bros. Kenyan coffee.  

for the road we got coffee beans, a pumpkin chocolate muffin and a fruit tart. they make all their stuff there and you can tell. no gooey commercialized sugared junk -just flaky not too sweet bakery goodness. 

also, free wi-fi and tables for working.

i like that you order at the counter and your food is delivered to the table. 

yummmm....
This place is a wonderful find. Sort of out of place amongst the run down buildings that pepper that neighborhood. Great breakfasts, if a bit pricey compared to some of the a.m. joints. Decent coffee, and a nice tea selection. A cozy atmosphere, low key enough to sit a bit and read.
We never seem to be up early enough to get out for breakfast, but this is one of our go-to lunch spots.  First, it's in our hood, second, there's nothing that's less than delicious here.  If you are a caffeine junky, you will be impressed and delighted w the size (and taste) of their large latte.  During the winter, when I think I'm going to freeze to death, I just wanna stick my feet in the cup, it's that big.  There is always a nice mix of people hanging out there.  i like that it's not just hipsters.  Because I am gluttonous, I often wish the portions were a bit bigger, but everything tastes so good, i can't really complain.  Their french countryside picnic salad is my fave item here.  Their chili is also excellent.  I recommend getting it w their fabulous french bread.  They have a really fun selection of soda pops too.
THE place to go on Madison's North Side.  Roomy, beautiful decor, family-operated, friendly staff.  The pastries are good, the bread and rolls are excellent, and the brunch and lunch menus are amazing!  There are lots of good vegetarian options, all clearly marked.  The Earthly Delights sandwich is my favorite--wow.  The soups and salads are also very, very good.

My only complaint is Manna's coffee, which is sometimes thin and over-extracted.  People who don't have a taste for good espresso may not mind (my Mom likes it fine), but I have to order a mocha or flavor syrup to cover up the bitter taste, and the texture of the mocha simply does not compare to what you'll get at the cafes on the square.  Still, it's probably the best coffee on the North Side.
This has fast become one of my favorite places to eat in Madison. I was willing to give it a try with some friends one Saturday afternoon, and it blew me away. They have delicious vegetarian fare, as well as a scrumptious-looking carnivorous menu. Everything I've had--from baked goods, to sandwiches, to drinks--has been extremely well done. Their pairing of ingredients for sandwiches is spot-on, and their homemade bread takes it to the next level of excellence. I cant leave without a sweet from their case--they're always different, and always top notch. I have yet to go for breakfast, but expect it's just as delicious. A must-try if you're in or around Madison.
I've only been to the Manna Cafe once - a client of mine took me there after a press check. We both had a breakfast sandwich - mine was "The Cravenous Carnivore". Consisted of scrambled egg, sausage, pepper jack and a little basil pesto. Who knew pesto would be good on an egg sandwich! Very yummy. Atmosphere was great and the baked goods looked fantastic. I definitely want to return soon!
As a kid, one of my favorite weekend rituals was taking apart and devouring a flaky, buttery, sugary morning bun at Ovens of Brittany. They set the standard for pastry. Ovens had a lot of other wonderful food, too (anyone recall their Chicken Pot Pie?), but they closed their doors too soon, leaving myself and fellow morning bun lovers out in the Wisconsin cold. 

Thankfully, the buns were brought back to life in the kitchen of Manna Cafe. Its proprietor, who also runs the Collins House B&B, knows good food and what people like. When I'm back in Madison, I always know I can visit Manna Cafe for my pastry (and quiche and sandwiches and coziness) fix. Keep up the good work!
Love the products. I give the food five stars. But the overall experience of trying to get the products prompts me to give three stars on Yelp. If you have time to kill and need a coffee or a super high-quality treat or sandwich this place is for you. I live nearby and would always try to swing in to grab something on my way to work. Gave up after awhile. I'm not looking for a Starbucks or McDonalds experience - but cripes, the pleasant but spacey staff are slow! If there is even one person in line ahead of you bring a book or a magazine to entertain yourself. Having said that - if you have nowhere to go and time on your hands - go to Manna - great people and fabulous products.
The location is great as there is almost nothing on the Northside of Madison. However, they make really incredible food and bread. The have their own flair for the standards (the reuben) as well as unique sandwiches and soups of their own. I've never tried the quiche, but am told it is superb. The have a nice arrangement of coffees (including a Fair Trade option). If you are going for lunch, it is best to get there before noon as the place really fills up fast.
I work nearby so I am definitely grateful that Manna is around. Not many lunch options in this neighborhood!  Most of their menu choices are relatively healthy, made from fresh, unprocessed and sometimes even local foods. Their menu is extensive, with a variety of soups, salads and sandwiches. I've yet to try something I didn't like. I love the Country Turkey Salad, and I've had many great sandwiches as well. 

While I live downtown, I also occasionally head to Manna for Sunday brunch. The oatmeal pancakes are great. Definitely worth driving a few extra miles. 

Service is good, it can sometimes take a while to get the food but that's understandable given how busy they are at lunch time. My only complaint is that they rarely pick up the phone when I try to call in a pickup order. Overall, an amazing option in the neighborhood!
Run, don't walk, to this wonderful little bakery.  My husband and I found it through Yelp during a two day stay in Madison.  We ordered our breakfast (a scramble off eggs and ham with potatoes and delicious toast) and took our coffees outside.  The meal was brought to us -- and was heavenly!  I love that it's local food, and love that the people who work there are friendly and obviously enjoy their jobs.  Thank you, Manna staff.  This is what hospitality is all about!
The staff here is very nice.  The food is decent.  The coffee is delicious.  The food is a little pricier than I usually like.  The quiche is worth it though.  Great atmosphere too.
Went on Saturday morning, for the first time. Had the breakfast basic and a regular americano. Breakfast came right away, but americano didn't, and had to wait more than 10 minutes while the breakfast was getting cold. I had to ask the guy making coffee, and apparently the order didn't go through. I had the regular size, which is the middle size, between small and large, I think. But he put only one shot of espresso in a regular americano. Do they put half-shot for the small? This was the first coffee place I've been to that puts one shot for a regular size. Finished my breakfast, and studied while drinking coffee at the smallest table (for two). I was asked to leave or move to the counter (obviously not suitable for studying) because there were a lot of people waiting. That was a little over 2 hours after I started my breakfast. Another first "cafe" that I've been to that downright told me to leave. Would not recommend to others.
Amazing sandwiches. Catrina's favorite is the best sandwich. Worth another visit. I will go again.
I believe that the majority of great reviews for restaurants in Madison, WI are based more on reputation and what people perceive than reality. Manna is one such restaurant. The food is good, but not outstanding. The menu selections are rather dated, much like the rest of Madison. This city has seen time pass them by. One walk into East Town Mall takes you back to 1990. The prices on par with other sandwich restaurants, but the portions are considerably smaller. I have been here a couple of times. The corned beef on the Reuben is tender, the Russian dressing is a little bitter, should be more sweet. Overall, the sandwich is just okay. I have also had the Collins Tenderloin. Basically, a roast beef sandwich, on a small roll. Many restaurants can produce the same sandwich. Manna is okay if you are in the area, but I would never say to drive here for the food. Lunch at a Corner Bakery can be more interesting.
I have serious quiche issues and Manna had wonderful quiche. Get there just before noon to be sure your quiche selection is available  (vegetarian or meaty). My four stars is for three reasons: 1. Not open past 5 p.m. (religious reasons), 2. Food is generally under seasoned, 3. A bit pricey.
My go-to place for caffeine, pastries and occasionally the stinky-bun french toast.  Can be hard to find a seat at peak bunch times and sometimes the kitchen seems slow but but it is still the best breakfast place I have been to on the east side.

I particularly like the tarts the sell though they tend to be under-cooked.
Checked out Manna while in Madison for Easter and we needed a place for a good brunch. The atmosphere was very laid back and coffee shop like. I tried the eggs benedict and sticky bun french toast. I thought the eggs benedict was great, especially with the avocado, tomato & bacon! The sticky bun french toast was a little too doughy/undercooked for me, although others in my group enjoyed it and/or had more well done versions. Overall, I thought this place had decent breakfast food.
I LOVE this place! It is a great neighborhood cafe with fantastic food and atmosphere.  I have taken out of town guests there for brunch and on subsequent visits they always ask to go back to Manna.  This is definitely my go-to default location for breakfast, brunch, or a light lunch.  The only thing I don't like is that it's often really crowded (a testament to how many people love the place) and their coffee isn't the greatest- tends to be a little on the strong, acidic side and it usually gives me a stomachache (and I generally like dark, strong coffee, but this is just a little much for me).  I also wish they were open past 3pm- it would be a great place to go in the evenings for tea and baked goods.
I love Manna Café, especially for the quiche of the day. Get there before noon to be assured a slice. Even then, sometimes they're sold out. Some food is under seasoned. Cookies, coffee are awesome.
Service has always been friendly and prompt. Coffee is great. The quiche is well portioned and delicious!
After years of coming here I can confidently say that it is consistently awesome. The bakery is some of the best in town specializing in various jewish pastries you don't see so much in Madison. The potatoe nachos with some sriracha is my favorite along with the virtuous veggie with bacon added! The coffee is always good too!
This has to be my favorite breakfast and lunch cafe. Their oatmeal pancakes are amazing and I get cravings for them every month. The sandwich and salad menu are filled with awesome choices - I'm trying to get through everything on the menu. It's a solid, reliable place! And, while it may appear busy, and even be completely full at times, if you have a little bit of patience, you will get a table before your food arrives. Also, despite what some have said, the servers are completely friendly. If I worked closer, I would definitely be here every week.
As good as it gets! Their food is amazing. Their coffee is wonderful. Their space is cozy and warm. I have never been disappointed.
Really good food at reasonable prices.  We went for Easter Brunch and it was a perfect place to dine- casual, comfortable and really good food.  

This was perfect.  I got the Veggie Breakfast Sammie and it was to die for.   The bread was so good and the egg and veggie just cooked perfectly with amazing flavor.  I think all the bakery is made in house as well as their granola.  

It is an order at the counter type place- no table service.  

The food is top-notch and a must for brunch!
We ditched the usual eat all you can buffet brunch for Easter and came here instead.  No reservations, but no problem.  Order at the counter and seat yourself.  The food is the reason to come.  It is all homemade, creative, organic, and delicious.  My eggs were creamy with asparagus and were served with a delicious cinnamon muffin and a bowl of fruit with whip cream.  I ate some of my wife's potato fries that were very nicely seasoned.  She had the veggie breakfast sandwich which was fresh and pleasing.  The bakery counter was hard to pass up but we were satisfied and full after the brunch.  I'll come back for the scones and pastry another time.
I had the Tenderloin Triumph today, and it was less than triumphant. I thought it would be a fairly hearty steak sandwich, and I was looking forward to the horseradish sauce and "rustic" French bread. Well, it was basically roast beef on white bread. The sauce had no kick and the bread had a totally bland and squishy texture. Ate a slice of German chocolate cake; the filling was yummy, but the cake was dry and not very flavorful.
Marzipan. Filled. Croissants. 

The marzipan-filled croissants alone earn a strong review for the Manna Cafe and Bakery, but truly every aspect of my dining experience there were very positive. Along with the croissant I had a pot of tea and a Southwestern-style Eggs Benedict, in which the eggs were served on top of cornbread with black beans and fried potatoes, covered in a spicy creamy sauce. It was a daily special, and I felt very special for the chance to eat it. Yuumm! The atmosphere was very relaxing, and the friendliness of the staff make it an extremely inviting place overall. I highly recommend the Manna Cafe & Bakery to anyone who wants an inexpensive meal that is fully of flavor and high-quality ingredients.

Manna Cafe & Bakery: Marzipan-filled croissants are only the beginning of the wonderful things to be had here!
Try a rugelach! Made from scratch bakery. Family style quiches for take away. Daily specials for breakfast. Pleasant outdoor seating, if you don't mind the parking lot. Almost always busy, for good reason. Mostly friendly staff. Family business. Delicious breakfasts, sandwiches and soups. Counter service only. My favorite baked item is the ham and cheese croissant. My only complaint: worst espresso I've had in a while.
The food is always yummy and perfect for folks with varying dietary needs. They can accommodate both vegetarians and gluten free folk as well as the standard diet. Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is inviting.
Reasonably priced, great country/farm-style food. Good selection. The maripan-filled croissants aren't the reason to eat here (try Cafe Soleil). Instead come here for the perfect frittata and generous plates fit only for the hunger called brunch.

Maybe its built into the low prices, but I could do without the kitchy decor, the noise and unremarkable bialys. Also, what happens if I don't want to eat my weight in eggs? Then I only eat coffee.

Bring some granola home.
I rarely get a chance to dine in, but the new to-go sandwich called the "Trendy Tendy (Tenderloin)" was drool worthy.  

And of course their baked muffins and croissants are still fantastic
Quiche!
Amazing food!  Everything is home-made daily and the sticky buns are the same as Ovens of Brittany's. You are missing out if you haven't been to this place.
Yes.
Yes. 
Yes.

1. Why did it take me forevs to check this place out?
2. Have you been, yet? 
3. Why are you still reading/not in the car? 

Breakfast is ridiculous. They serve up some of the best pancakes I've ever eaten, so good I went back two weekends in a row. Funky Monkey is my new fave. It starts with their oatmeal pancakes (a famous recipe for Manna) and includes chocolate chips wrapped into the batter, a sliced banana and peanut butter. You know how sliced bananas are sometimes super oogie at places? Not here. Just delicious. Honestly I'm afraid to try more of the menu because these cakes killed it two weekends in a row!
I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to eat breakfast or lunch here. Most of their menu items are rather "non-traditional", so if you're looking for some good old fashioned pancakes, or a "normal" sandwich, this is not the place for you.
It may be off the beaten path, but it's worth the shlep.  Our office ordered lunch carryout from here and, for once, everyone was pleased as punch with our restaurant choice.  The menu offers loads of options, from sandwiches ($6.95-$9.50) to salads, from cheesy to healthy.  Combos are an option too, for those who are indecisive. It's so fun to get to look at a menu and have multiple, creative vegetarian dishes to choose from.  All sandwiches come with a side dish too, and you're not stuck with just fries or potato chips - I'm talkin' couscous salad or mixed greens to be had!  

I had the Veggie Might Sandwich (artichokes, spinach, roasted red peppers, onions, feta) and upgraded my side option to a cup of the lentil soup (+$1.50, toootally worth it - delish!)  Each day there are different soups (always a veg option too) and various quiches of the day.  All are listed on the website, which is quite helpful and probably cuts down on redundant phone calls. 

The cafe itself is bright and cheerful, spacious with plenty of tables.  I inquired about their weekend breakfast/brunch rush and was informed by the staff that it's usually pretty bustling but there's never much of a wait at all for a table.  Score!!  With lunch being as good as it was, I would definitely add this spot to my brunch "to-do" list.
Good food - good atmosphere.  My favorite dish is the french toast - they used to make it out of cinnamon rolls which was absolutely to die for.  Now it's made out of sticky buns, not as good.  I miss the cinnamon rolls.  

Good veggie sandwich for lunch too.
Delicious roasted vegetable salad and Earthy Delights sandwich. Many creative menu selections. Lots of comfy seating, Friendly staff. I would come more often if I knew they were buying from local sources...was disappointed to see that the butter came from Minnesota, What's up with that?
Manna Cafe is an excellent spot to grab a quick lunch and yummy lunch!!! I cannot say just how long I have been driving right by this place and never even noticed it was there but I am glad my hunny talked me into stopping by. The chicken sandwhich was great and perfectly sized - If you want soemthing that trumps the local fast food joint then Manna should be on your list. They have a rather large seating area inside and a small pation area outside. The place is neat and clean and everyone was very friendly.
Delicious!  A great breakfast spot with lots of seating options.  Outdoor seating is on the edge of the parking lot so that's not great.  Their food is excellent though and they have a large center table if you have a big group.
Best Eggs Benedict in town. Best. I love this place and you should, too. Fresh baked goods, excellent, piping hot and lemony zesty eggs benedict. I love it.
Love it the menu choices the coffee the setting , try not to go weekends no tables but that's comes with the best
I stopped by here this past Sunday morning for brunch.  We arrived at the restaurant shortly before 10 and the place was already packed.  Almost every table inside was taken and the line to order your food was almost out the door.  This is the type of place where you order at the counter, they give you a number (in this case a spoon with a number on it) and then they bring your food out to you whenever it is ready.  Whenever I saw a table getting up, I quickly told my fiance my order and swooped in to grab it.  A short time later she was back at our table with our coffee drinks.  Whatever she had ordered coffee-wise was quite reasonable in size especially compared to the large Americano that I had ordered.  Hers was a normal coffee cup while mine seemed like it came in a large drinking glass that I would be more comfortable drinking beer out of than coffee and the vessel was almost as big as my head.  Regardless of that, the Americano was made well and tasted good and I did eventually finish it long after we had finished our meals.  For my entree I went with the sweet hot mama omelet which was an omelet with bacon, sweet sweet potato, caramelized onion, pepper jack, and a side of spicy homemade salsa.  It also came with a bialy and pan fried potatoes which ended up being the best part of the meal.  The pan fried potatoes had a good crunch to them while the bialy had a good firm texture on the outside but was soft on the inside.  My omelet wasn't too bad either as the eggs were cooked nicely and the bacon crispy but it definitely felt like it was missing something.  That was probably where the spicy homemade salsa would have fit well into the meal but I honestly could not taste any spice on it and so I used it sparingly.  After I had finished my brunch I noticed others bringing back an array of sauces (BBQ and different types of hot) from a common area which I wish I would have noticed while eating.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future especially if I needed a pick me up from some coffee.  It didn't take long for us to both order and receive our food, the food itself was solid and reasonably priced and finally the coffee was absolutely ginormous!
YUM. If you're looking for an average brunch experience in which you leave semi-full and semi-satisfied, I'm telling you: DO NOT go to Manna. The Granola Crunch Cakes are to die for (sweet but not overly so, crunchy, fluffy, and perfect with some sliced bananas and Wisconsin maple syrup). Ben got My Big Fat Greek Scramble with a bialy and fried potatoes which he gave two big thumbs up while scarfing it down. The space is large yet cozy and the staff is warm. My only qualm was that it was a bit expensive ($9.50 for my pancakes), but also very worth it. I left deliciously stuffed and will be craving those pancakes until I go back again.
We stopped in during the morning rush.  We have only been there one other time. So I felt uncomfortable not knowing immediately what we wanted.  
The sticky bun was a hit with us.  The swiss cheese & ham croissant was flaky and not overly cheesy.  Certainly worth the time and money.  I suggest stopping in when it's not so busy to check out the menu. 
Listening to the group of older men sitting and chatting outside made me smile.
Cute and cozy coffee shop. I've stopped here once and have a sandwich and chai tea. Service was excellent.
Get the quiche. Get the quiche. Get the quiche. 
I thought I knew what well prepared quiche tastes like, then I found myself at Manna on a rainy Friday morning. It melts in your mouth like a good piece of chocolate with just enough light crisp on top to keep you coming back for another bite. I'd go out of my way for this alone. 
Bottomless coffee was a fair $2.50 and the walnut poppy seed rugelach was worth it too.
When I lived on the north side of Madison I are here almost every week... It's that good! They have a wide selection of hot or cold sandwiches and bakery items. My favorite sandwich is the Sunshine Dreamin' with couscous as the side. 
For breakfast everything is good, I mean it. Whatever you pick will be amazing. They use fresh ingredients and work to balance flavors so that each bite is better than the last. If you go on the weekend the bread served with the meals is a traditional Jewish bread called a Bilay. I wish I knew how to make them because I miss having a Bilay on Sunday morning before heading to one of Madison's lovely beaches. 
If you chose to visit this cute cafe located in a not so cute old building you'll be begging to come back.
Good food and atmosphere. Great for breakfast.
I was in the neighborhood to drop off shoes at the shoe repair place a few doors down and decided to grab a hot beverage.  I could see through the window that this place was hopping (on a Thursday at lunchtime) and once in the door took two steps and got in line. There was a bakery case showing some beautiful stuff, which I eyeballed while the ladies in front of me tried to figure out what they wanted. 

I ordered my latte and went over to the beverage pick-up area to wait. I was surprised to see another cash register that is, I think, just for ordering drinks. I wasn't in a giant hurry, but that would have shaved some time off, so duly noted for next time. It took a few minutes longer than I expected for my drink, but as the place was full of people, there seemed to be just one employee running the espresso machine, and she was busy the whole time, it wasn't so bad. 

Once I got my caramel latte (I only get them a few times a year, they're an indulgence) I felt like getting back in line for another one. Dang, it was terrific. Easily the best I've ever had. Not bitter at all, not too sweet, it was the baby bear of lattes.
SCONES. Scones. scones. 

Oatmeal date are perfect. Lemon-Iced Earl Grey Tea are divine.

I've also been back several times since my last review and have come to really like the Peter Wrappit sandwich (a spinach wrap sprinkled with frizzled onions, asparagus, greens, red cabbage, carrots, and red pepper relish). 

But seriously, scones.
Hey you know what's awesome? 
A burrito to go. 
With bacon, eggs, taters, onion and some salsa on the side this bad boy remind me of my days in the southwest. Haven't found a foldable quite like this and I love... no ADORE that it comes with grilled pineapple on the side!
I visited Manna on a weekday morning when working from home. The weekend brunch menu seems to have a few more options, but there were still many delicious-sounding dishes to choose from, in addition to the pastries and quiche of the day.

I tried the Garden Goddess sandwich, which had interesting flavors with sweet potato, egg, and curried mayo. I didn't really like the addition of red onion...tasted a little odd compared to the other flavors in the sandwich. I like the option of having greens with house dressing as the side. House dressing was yummy and a nice citrusy contrast to the rich flavors in the sandwich.

Unlimited coffee, free wifi, plenty of comfy spaces to sit.
Try the oatmeal pancakes!  They will change your life.  I'm not even a big fan of pancakes but I find myself craving these.  I have to say that everything I've had here was wonderful.
Manna has pretty tasty food at an affordable price, but with the Madison brunch scene setting the bar so high, it's not wow-ing me.

We ventured over to this hidden gem last Sunday for brunch. We showed up around 10:30, which was good, because by 11, the line was way out the door. Although the ordering process went pretty smoothly, that's where it ended. After placing your order, there's not much room to wait for a table. You get a number when you first walk in, which holds your place in line for a table (the same one they use to bring your food), but it's still a bit hectic.

When we were seated and got our food, it was excellent. I got the Walk In the Woods scramble with greens. It came with a bialy, which was awesome, but I'd like to see more traditional Jewish food on the menu.

Other pros: delicious bakery items, cool coffee drinks

Other cons: location, hours

Try it if you've never been, but not one of my favorites.
I really have nothing bad to say about this place other than it is too far from my house! The decor is very cozy and clean.  It was consistently crowded when we were there, but it never felt like you were being rushed.  You get seated and then order from the counter.  I prefer this to ordering and then hoping there  is an empty table like they do it at Marigold Kitchen.  I had the The Ojibwe Scramble, a mix of wild rice, mushroom, bacon and scallions, sautéed and then scrambled with a little egg. You have a choice of breakfast potatoes, fruit or greens.  I chose the fruit.  It also comes with a little bun called a bialy. My breakfast was excellent.  If there weren't so many other things I want to try on their menu, I would just order this again and again.  I also ordered tea and it comes in a little pot with a cup.  It lasted me the entire time we were there.  Impressive. On the way home I bought two sticky buns and a loaf of challah bread.  The sticky buns were so good, I wished I had bought more. So, again, nothing bad to say, can't wait to go again.
Friendly service!  The quiche and granola pancakes are both delicious!  The lattes are huge.  I've also had the Peter Wrappit, which was very good.  We generally go to Manna for brunch.  I'd say it's one of our favorites in Madison!

The dinner service is really nice.  It has a really different vibe than the breakfast atmosphere.  They accept Bicycle Benefits!
The food is always great at Manna. I've been here a lot, and it's always been delicious. It's a good place to go and eat and catch up with friends.

I usually go for brunch, which can get pretty busy. Go-to menu items for me are the El Cubano sandwich, BFW wrap and the breakfast burrito. I've had some scones, pie and other bakery items and they are always fantastic. They also offer some gluten-free items, which is great.

The space is large and warm. The staff is very nice and outgoing. The prices are reasonable.  

BUT, I do not like how things work since they remodeled. The remodel itself made the space a lot bigger. Fantastic. But before, you could order your food and pay at the counter and then find a seat and your wait for your food. Easy. But now, a host will seat you and give you a table number. Then you have to get up and go order your food at the counter with your number, and then go back and sit down and wait for you food. And then you have to get up again and go pay at the counter. It's a stupid setup, and not nearly as convenient as it was before. Too much running back and forth for the customer.

But besides this confusing new setup, the food remains good. Also, I hear they are going to start serving dinner sometime in March!
Manna always served up delicious, affordable brunch, lunch, and bakery. Plus it has great authentic Jewish treats like bialys and hamentaschen! 

I've been coming here for years and probably have an extra 10 lbs because of it... Rustic fruit tarts, quiche, and oatmeal pancakes. You will not be disappointed! 

Bonus points? Lots of local, organic, and fair trade food. Champagne! And ample parking. Why go anywhere else?!
You will never view quiche the same after you eat a slice here. Every day you will find two flavors, each with in-season (to the extent possible) ingredients, including pairings you may not have thought possible. Do not stress yourself with counting calories, because every savored bite is worth that stick of butter you are consuming. As good as the quiche is, I'd eat a pan of that pie crust on its own.

I drop in a day or two a week for their fresh Johnson Brothers coffee. The sunrise muffin is exceptionally good and has some veggies in it, so I pass that off as healthy.

The only thing that is frustrating is the slowness of the service. I think they could be more efficient using the two registers and having another person fetching coffee and goodies while the cashier keeps a steady flow ringing up customers. Speaking of customers, it amazes me there are menus clearly posted and visible, plus paper copies you can hold in your hand and read, yet nearly no one is prepared to order when it's their turn. It drives me crazy when I need an express lane during those early morning visits on my way to the office.
Great brunch menu...good portion sizes, yummy bakery treats and a great latte.  I look forward to trying other menu items in the bear future!
I had the scrambler with asparagus and mushroom.  I was offered to add meat..I did and added chicken sausage.  I didnt realise it was going to be a side instead of in it.  I also asked for a side of fruit.  My husband chose the breakfast nachos.  My husband thought his dish was ok.  I only tasted the salsa,which was good.   I did not like the chicken sausage because there was too much thyme (I have a sensitive palette) and thankful it wasn't in my eggs.  The scrambler was tasty and the potatoes were OK.  I liked the choice of fruit in my side.  All in all I'd return but try something else.  Oh..and I tried the iced chocolate milk and espresso (magic mocha?)...not a fan.  It just was a bit gritty and I was looking for a little more chocolate taste.
Such a cute place!  A little off the beaten path, but don't be fooled: the locals obviously know and love this quaint bakery/ cafe--the place was hoppin!  The quiche is amazing!
A local friend brought us here when we passed through Madison.  We had the brisket sandwich special, the vegetarian Monty Python, the Mediterranean platter, a rustic cherry tart, and a peanut butter layered cookie.  Everything was remarkably good, and I would love to go again!
I really like Manna.  I work pretty close, and all my coworkers have always raved about it.  It took me awhile to finally get my butt over there and try it, and when I finally did, I seriously wondered what took me so long.  The first thing I had was a Rueben, and it was pretty much perfect.  The meat was tender and juicy, the bread perfectly toasted.  It was dripping with a delicious Russian dressing and it pretty much melted in my mouth. Since then, I've gone back multiple times, and it quickly became one of me and my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.  While the Rueben isn't exactly an image of health, they have many healthy, fresh menu items that all taste equally as delectable.  I've tried the vegetarian peter wrappit (light, fresh, flavorful), and the not-so-vegetarian southwest quinoa chicken wrap (also fresh, but spicy, savory, and really filling), and both were delicious.  The staff has always been incredibly warm, friendly, and cheery, even amidst the chaos that is their regular weekend brunch madness (proceed with caution on the weekends, it is VERY popular, but absolutely worth the wait).  

My boyfriend and I enjoy playing Scrabble while we wait for our food (they have board games!), and we take desserts to go.  We both agree that the cookies and brownies taste like the best homemade desserts of their variety that we've had, and we always leave feeling satisfied and looking forward to our next visit.

We haven't been for dinner yet (as they just expanded their hours to include dinner) but we glanced at the dinner menu and needless to say, we're excited.  Contented dinner review to follow, as I'm certain we won't be let down.
This is a great neighborhood cafe and restaurant. Great coffee, AMAZING baked goods, awesome food. Mentionables include: Monte Cristo sandwich, peanut butter chocolate ripple cookie, sticky bun, and frittatas. Omelettes are great but a little runny. Only minus is the location. Not very accessible.
This place is magnificent! Perfect atmosphere for any amount of people, amazing food, amazing and friendly and attentive staff. I've eaten here twice, once for breakfast and once for lunch, and although things are a wee bit on the expensive side, I always leave wishing I had gotten seconds to go.

Also worth noting, since they just recently rolled out dinner as an option, they have amazing and creative dishes, incredible drinks, and it's super easy to get a nice caffeine fix at dinner time in addition to breakfast and lunch.

Suggestion? Get yr butt out here ASAP. It's good stuff and I promise you won't be disappointed.
A GREAT brunch location, it was one of my favorite coffee shops and erstwhile workplaces when I lived on the northside.

Well-done drinks, gluten-free cookies, bread, and pastries in addition to everything else done in-house, and reliable wi-fi.

Staff is always quite friendly, even when things get crazy-busy.

The only thing that would make this place better are longer hours, as I do a lot of work and socializing after 3pm.. =)
Love this place!  I've only been here twice, both for lunch and both times were excellent.  Great place to get a sandwich - hot or cold. Fresh products make this a nice lunch spot. I'll definitely be back.
In my suicidal quest to find a chicken fried steak equal to the one I had outside of Houston, I insisted to Hubby that we try the Ranch House Grille today, on the NE corner of Thomas and 56th street, across from the Walgreens. It's open from 6am-3pm only, and when we arrived at 2:00, there were few other customers. It's pretty homey (if home is Oklahoma) and casual, with around 15 tables inside and several outside.

I ordered the CFS, and it was quite good, very tender with a white sausage gravy on top. The rest of the meal ranged from mediocre (mashed boxed taters and Texas toast) to awful (the vegetable mix that was just this side of baby food soft).

Hubby had a better meal overall- an egg burrito with some truly delicious homemade pork chili verde sauce, paired with crispy but not greasy shredded hash browns. They needed some seasoning, but were nowhere near the disaster that was the biscuits. Something was just wrong with them, besides being pale and puckish- too much baking powder, maybe? 

I think there are some tasty gems on the menu, but you may have to wade through a few sub-par items to suss them out.
nice portions of very solid breakfast food; you won't leave hungry.  Decent service, but they should pay closer attention to keeping everything clean, consistently....reasonable prices.
I absolutely love this place.  Don't go in here expecting anything but good traditional food.  I don't believe anything here is really healthy.  I read a previous review that mentioned soggy veggies...I had a Ranchero Breakfast (sans veggies) and it was awesome...The food was really fresh and service was great
This spot has been previous host to Anna's Cafe (RIP), BYOBistro (RIP), Nix (RIP). But finally, I think someone put the right thing in here. A casual, daytime breakfast and lunch spot that caters to a slightly older crowd. We can literally walk here, so we hit it from time-to-time. But it doesn't have the same charm or unique menu favorites (Eggs Maximillian, Parisienne, etc) that a place like Harlow's in Tempe does. You need that to pull people from outside the hood.

DECOR
I would call it kitchsy country cafe, but they mean it. So it's not kitschy. It seriously looks like a midwestern diner, in 1974. No nonsense.


FOOD
Pretty good. Wish it were better. Good, hearty breakfast. Eggs cooked nicely, as ordered. Meats and sides prepared competently. Standard, reliable comfort food. It's straight-up midgrade foodservice stuff. Ultimately, frozen Shamrock/Sysco everything. Some things are better than others: the green chile poured over greasy fries is an excellent gutbomb. But the burgers are overcooked - maybe the meat necessitates that. Seems like a kickass burger should be a staple at a place like this.

I still have some menu exploration to do, so I'll update.

All in all, they seem to be doing well and serving their demographic what they want. I just wish Matt's was across the street instead.
If your looking for a traditional, down home, country breakfast, then Ranch House Grille is your destination. From the moment you walk in, you are taken back to a small town eatery, where everyone would have to know each others names. Located just East of 56th Street and North of Thomas Road, Ranch House is within walking/beach cruiser distance for anyone in the Arcadia and South Scottsdale neighborhoods. From traditional favorites such as biscuits and gravy, pancakes, scrambled eggs, thick cut bacon, waffles and baked goods, Ranch House has the stick to your insides good breakfast that is much needed on a relaxing Saturday or Sunday morning. Although during the work week, they open at 6am, and you can start off a boring Tuesday with a Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs, what could be better?

If you want good comfort breakfast, with no frills other than great flavors, check  out the Ranch.
Good ol' breakfast joint.  The best kind, too.  Consistent.  Friendly service.  And you won't leave hungry.  The chicken fried steak is so good it's as if they asked Scotty to beam it straight 'n' steamin' from Texas to your danged ol' plate.  My first bite transported me back to the Lone Star State, but I quickly regained consciousness 'cause I wanted to eat more of it.  Order it slathered in either green chile verde or creamy sausage gravy.  Bein' a Texas boy my vote's on the latter.  Do yourself a huge flavor par'ner -- order it!
Broke out of the hood to go to Ranch House Grill. Wow, down home service,  comfortable patio - with a view, and awesome Eats. Breakfast burritos really hit the mark. Good beans, as a side option. Coffee kicks.

One small note by the Beau: gravy for the biscuits was a bit salty.

Overall, great option for breakfast with good value and satisfying food. Go with an appetite!
Really a cute place.  I loved patio area and thought the service was great.  Big giant Oreganos-sized soda cups kept me happy and the crowd was a great mix of people.  Also, there was no wait on a Saturday morning which is a good thing since we drove by Over Easy and there was a small mob standing outside.

As far as the food goes, it was okay.  On par with Denny's or IHOP, I guess.  The hashedbrowns were overly hashed and turned to mashed.  The breakfast sandwich I had was pretty tasty but was only saved by the massive amount of cheese on it.  

I might got back but there are so many other options.  I give it four stars simply because no wait, food is adequate, and the service is excellent.
I almost give this place 3 stars, but as far as my experience goes, it's not there yet, and I would honestly rather have IHOP or Denny's.  Saturday morning at 9:30ish seems to be prime time for breakfast, and Over Easy proved that with the gaggle of people hanging out outside.  Since I was starving we quickly found another place via Yelp Mobile, and we ended up here. 

The patio is cute with tons of shade provided by the greenery.  The inside however is awfully tacky and very poorly put together.  I was embarrassed for the owners just looking at it.  We were told to sit anywhere and we found ourselves at a little two top against the wall.  Service was prompt and we were quickly given our GIANT cups of soda, always a plus for me.  I ordered a dish that had hash browns, 3 eggs any way, bacon, and I subbed biscuits and gravy for the bread.  The amount of food on my plate was massive.  The hash browns took up a whole third of the plate real estate, but that was unfortunate as they were rather tasteless.  They were lacking in the salt/grease/butter department.  Next up, my eggs were overcooked in the yolk part but somehow not cooked enough in the whites.  It was weird, but still edible and not the way I like them.  The bacon... well there was a lot of it.  I thought that was a wonderful thing until I bit into overly fatty bacon that was cooked for way too long.  It was just really salty and crunchy.  For the first time ever, I did not eat all of the bacon in front of me.  The biscuits and gravy was by far the worst part of my meal.  The biscuits were very hard, dry, and flavorless.  It was as if they had been sitting out for at least a few days.  The gravy was pretty bad.  It was completely over-peppered and was super thick and congealed.  It wobbled instead of dripped.  Kind of gross.  When I smothered it on top of the hash browns it was a little bit better.

The husband enjoyed his dish much more than I did mine.  Maybe we will go back some time, but I know what to avoid and how to specify my bacon to be cooked.  For now, it's just a meh.
I took my second visit to Ranch House Grille today for brunch, and I think it was even better than I remembered! I brought two rookies with my, and they both thought that the homey interior made the place so cute and loved the home-style theme of the menu. 

The service is wonderful, everyone that works there is so friendly and always have a smile on their face. The coffee is really good, and they are very good about keeping your cup full. 

I again had the Light Chicken Fried Steak Breakfast (it is funny that they call it light, because the only light part is that it comes with one egg and a half order of the hashbrowns) but it makes you feel good when ordering! They are known for their Chicken Fried Steak here, and for good reason, it is delicious!! It is nice and tender, with a well seasoned crispy coating and smothered in a peppery white gravy. My two companions had never had Chicken Fried Steak before (which I find hard to believe because I think every elementary school cafeteria had it on the menu!), and they both were pleasantly surprised when they took their tastes. I also upgraded to biscuits and gravy instead of toast, but I could barely make it through half of a biscuit!! They give you two large biscuits and a bowl of their delicious gravy, my mom always makes biscuits and gravy Christmas morning, and while very different from my mom's version, this was very good! 

My two companions both had the Eggs Benedict that was the special today. One of them in particular makes it a habit to try Eggs Benedict at every restaurant in town, and she declared this to be an excellent version. She said that the hollandaise was really good, which can make or break the overall dish! 

The three of us really enjoyed our meal, and I am thinking we will definitely be back again! They are well known for their Pork Chile Verde, which I have yet to try, but I always seem to get drawn to the Chicken Fried Steak....but maybe next time!
I want to love this place because it's so close to my house and I really like to see local restaurants succeed. I've eaten here about 5 times and my experience is always the same - mediocre food and slow service.  And the place needs to be cleaned up a bit as the torn table clothes and dingy carpet are rather gross.  Patio area is a decent option when the weather is mild and the staff seems like they want you to have a good experience so I'll give this place another try.  It doesn't hurt that we get a coupon in the mail every month.
Cute...there's really no other word that covers what you see when you walk in to the Ranch House Grill:)

There's gingham, lariats, spurs, split rails, barbed wire, saddles and all kinds of "ranchy" things in the décor.

The décor is basically what my mother probably wanted to accomplish with the ranch house that I grew up in (and maybe could have, if she'd figured out how cover up the 40 year old wall paper, the dead white linoleum floors, and hot pink appliances and kitchen sink:(

But enough about me:)

The menu here is basic, but well executed, and what more can you ask from a place that bills itself as country cookin'?...Not much in my book:)

This is the second RHG location (the first is in Page, on the way to Colorado City, I guess so you can fuel up with big food, so you have enough energy to "visit" all your wives:)

This RHG location brings that small town, big food, restaurant feel to SE Phoenix:)

Lunching with some buddies the other day...we decided to give RHG a test drive...none of us had been there before (in fact, I think lots people haven't been here...and they should be going to RHG:)

Walked in at noon, had our drinks almost before we asked (I said "almost before"...to say we had them any sooner would imply a temporal causality paradox that I don't want to deal with here...email me if you want the math:)

The menu is "robust"...not much in the "amuse bouche" section, but plenty of "steak and eggs" options.

I selected Chicken Fried Steak with double mashed potatoes...and gravy...incredible, delectable gravy!:)

RHG has a sign outside that says they have been voted "Best Chicken Fried Steak" in Phoenix, by somebody...I'm adding my vote to the total:)...It was outstanding...hand pounded round steak, sausage gravy, buttery mashed potatoes and thick toast...I haven't had CFS this good since the last time I was in Waco.

My luncheon companions had, respectively, a Patty Melt (which he said was as good as any he'd ever had...hyperbole?...sure, but he's an attorney and given to hyperbole:), and a Chili and Cheese Omelet (BTW, I'm going back just for their chili...two kinds...red beef and green pork...both homemade and both crazy good:)

The platters (that's right, I said "platters") of food arrived and we spent the next half hour wading through the food...more than plenty to eat!...a ranchers lunch in the truest sense of the word...enough food to keep you going through a long afternoon of building barb wire fence, bucking hay, herding recalcitrant bovines and mucking out the feed barn...none of which I have done since I was 15 years old...thank god!:)

It also helps, even if you're just pounding out emails and answering phones:)

Every so often, you need a lunch like this one...Mark Knopfler said it best..."if you want to run cool, you have to run on heavy, heavy fuel":)

http://tinyurl.com/y8nw3ds

The bill came to about $10 apiece and the service was 25% tip range service:)

I think RHG fits the description of "hidden gem":)...It is a gem and you really have to look for it to find it:)

It will help if you look at the intersection of Thomas and 56th Street:)
This is a nice local breakfast and lunch place with a southwestern style theme. Eating here makes you feel like your in a small town with very friendly service and hearty food. I ordered the Southwestern style country fried steak which comes covered in their chili verde sauce (doesn't look like much but very good) and upgraded to the biscuits and gravy ( good gravy, ok biscuits).  My only complaint was the hasbrowns were undercooked and mushy. I will order them extra crispy next time. 

The others at my table got the huevos reancheros which wasn't that good and the Lumberjack which included eggs and three breakfast meats, all which looked good. 

Consensus was large portions, decent food, and a nice comfortable place with good service. Check it out if your in the neighborhood.
Only the best for the Beautiful Carin...that's what I tell her constantly...that's why she chose me...that's why I take her only the best places...Like Ranch House Grille:)

Surprisingly, she hadn't been to RHG with me before now, so off we went for Saturday "Lunfast" after our workout...(I was going to call it brunch, but it was Saturday and about 1:00 pm so it kind of felt like a retox lunch time thingy, but I had breakfast, so...:-)

Carin was charmed by the rustic decor and the family atmosphere at RHG (these folks are from up around Page, Arizona...this is the southern outpost of the family restaurant empire:)

She was more charmed by the food:)

I ordered up a Chili Verde Omelet (I need to digress for minute...I've always been a red chili "snob" when it comes to chili omelets...I mean who thinks Green Pork Chili on an Omelet?...well, I do...now:-)...this is really the adult version of "Green Eggs and Ham" (BTW, RHG can steal that for their menu if they want...I don't mind:)

I am astonished at how well the flavors of the rich and meaty green pork chili work with the fresh fluffy eggs in the omelet...this is what the word "sublime" was invented to describe:)

Carin continued her very healthy ways with a veggie omelet made with egg whites...although I did notice that about 20% of my omelet was "missing" when I returned from a brief visit to the clean and shiny restrooms:)

She said there was a commotion in the restaurant while I was gone, and when she turned back from gawking, part of my Lunfast omelet was missing...but I don't know...there were unexplained Chili Verde traces on her plate:-)

She said next time we go, I can get the Chicken Fried Steak and eggs and she will get the Chili Verde Omelet...maybe she'll let me share:-)
This place is just down the street from my house, so we finally made our way over here to check it out, as my partner and I both love a good brunch.

I don't think either of us will be back. The wait was only a couple in front of us, but took almost 25 minutes to be seated, and the way the restaurant was laid out, we had to basically stand in front of the door while waiting.  Also, I had to chase down the waiter to even get on the wait list.

Once seated, I opened the menu, ready to get the black bean burger I'd seen online...their only non-egg vegetarian item.  I had purposely scouted the menu online before coming in, since they didn't seem super veg friendly.

Yeah. Apparently, they no longer serve veggie burgers. Nope.  So when I asked our server, as a vegetarian, what I could get, she told me there was some sort of dish that one of the servers made with cottage cheese, mushrooms and avocado.  I had no option but to ask for that.

When it came out, after a good deal of time, it was a small cup of oily mushrooms, a plate with half an avocado on it, and a small cup of cottage cheese.  Um. Gross.

I stole a piece of my partner's toast, mixed in ketchup with the mushrooms, and put it on the toast with a little avocado on top. It was ok, but I could have made it better myself, and for less than the almost $7 they charged me for my "meal."

Add to that the homophobia and transphobia we felt, plus the coffee refill guy walking past my partner's empty cup not once, not twice, but three times, and we'll not be back. Which is too bad, because my partner love love loved her Denver omlette and hashbrowns.  Folks, it takes more than good food to make a good restaurant.
Two or three times a year, when my dad comes to town, we have to go eat a chicken fried steak at the Ranch House.  We heard about this place from our old roommate who is a chef, and my dad couldn't wait to go try it.  Typically a healthy eater, my dad loves to splurge on something artery-clogging from time to time.  I'm just glad I get to go along for the ride.  The first time we went, my dad noticed a not-so-svelte man sitting at a table in front of the window.  My dad looked toward him and said "Ooohh.  This is gonna be GOOD!"  He was right.

The chicken fried steak is tender and juicy, the eggs have always been perfectly fine and the gravy is so thick and creamy I can feel it taking years off my life.  Pancakes are an easy kid-pleaser, so everyone comes out full and content.  

I'm glad I get to go here once or twice a year and that's enough for me.
This is a great mom and pop type restaurant. They have good food and good service. You walk in and it feels like home. I have ate there a few times now and have had good food every time. The hot burger is unique. The green onion burger was awesome. Nothing you can get is bad. 

I am trying the chicken fried steak there next!
Poor guy that was waiting on tables was by himself the day their Groupon went live. He currently has 9 tables for lunch. We'll see how the food is....

It was really good. Chicken fried steak. Yum.
In search of the Valley 5-Star breakfast spot to replace Black Bear Diner on Bell Rd. that went from 5-Stars to 1-Star & then folded (!), I stopped in here this morning.  My order consisted of the Down Home Country Breakfast, of ham, 3 eggs, hashbrowns ($8.75), & I opted for biscuits & gravy rather than toast (+ $1.75), & coffee ($1.50).  Here's how it went:

*  Atmosphere ok.  It's a mid-sized place with tables only, no booths, but it's rather nice inside, & not rowdy & crowded like Matt's...  at least it wasn't for me this time.

*  Good service.

*  Coffee not that great.  Whatever it is, Apffels, for instance, would be much better.

*  Ham steak fairly generous, oval, about 4x7", 1/4" thick.  Flavor ok, not exciting.

*  Good serving of hash browns, about the same size as the ham.

*  Two big biscuits with a cup of gravy to top them with...  too salty, & gravy had only a little sausage in it.

They're open 7 days 6 AM to 3 PM, & worthy of a return visit!
At last a breakfast place that delivers. The chicken fried steak and eggs were  very good, hash browns were buttery and crisp. Would have been a 5 star but service was slow.
Total random location in a strip mall type thing. Had to park in the back, as the front is almost always full. 
I have no idea how I happened upon this place, but I'm glad I did, it never disappoints. The wait staff seem like a family, I could be wrong, but I liked that about it. 
The food was very good. I had an omelette on one occassion and the country fried steak on another. Always have leftovers, the portions are pretty big. The prices are excellent for the amount of food you get. You might have to wait a bit for your food, but its worth it.
Ranch House Grill gets a big fat "Meh" from me. I love breakfast joints and am always looking for new places to try. When I got a Groupon for Ranch House Grill I was hoping I would find a new place to add to our rotating list of breakfast hot spots. Not so much.

The boyfriend and I went there on a Sunday morning, there was a wait but nothing too long. I ordered the special - cinnamon raisin french toast, eggs and bacon. Boyfriend got a ham and cheese omelet which he did say was pretty good. My food was okay but nothing special. The french toast was kinda small and didn't have a ton of flavor. Eggs were fine, bacon was okay. There was nothing bad about the food but there just wasn't anything great about it either. At least nothing to make me want to go back. Except maybe the Savers down the street - I found some great clothes there!
I'm dropping Ranch House Grill into the diner category, and in that category they rate a nice 3 stars.

The service was prompt and friendly, the prices were fair and the food was pretty good.

The huevos rancheros with roasted pork green chili was very tasty.  I would probably get that again if I were dining at Ranch House Grill again.

The diced green chili and cheese omelet was less impressive.  The green chili in the omelet didn't have alot of flavor and the omelet itself needed more cheese.  The shredded potatoes were nice and buttery but I like them with some crispiness, at least on the top and bottom.  These were a bit soggy but still good.  They just needed another minute on the grill.
Nothing bad about this place. Charming and cute. A little expensive for what it is. I prefer 5th Ave Cafe, which has similarly good quality but for a lot less.
The green chile that they are known for is, in fact, quite good.
Everything on the breakfast menu is a little overpriced, but not horribly so.
It's a locally owned place, I think run by a family, which counts for some points with me.
Too bad the service is horrible. After we checked in with the host, multiple parties (larger, smaller, and the same size as ours) were all seated before us. When we finally did get seated, the waitress was inattentive and not knowledgeable about the menu. After a 40 minute wait (for breakfast!) she brought out the wrong plate of food, which my friend was just going to eat because we didn't want to wait for another plate to be made. Instead, after he had taken a bite, she did bring out the correct plate. That would have been great except we saw her JUST BRING THAT SAME PLATE OVER TO ANOTHER TABLE!!! Wow. When we complained later to the manager, he said "I know, I've heard it all before. Just pay up and don't come back, I guess." That has got to be the worst customer service I've ever experienced! Too bad Ranch House Grille, I really wanted to add you to my Phoenix rotation!
Service was a tad sketchy. Had to ask a few times for coffee. Maybe he was in the weeds. But wondered if we just didn't look like decent tippers. That would be a shame.
I've always enjoyed the food here though.
Came at the last minute for a lunch, party of 3.  Had one of the best burgers I've ever had.  I was happy for days after that one.  Cooked exactly as I ordered, medium rare, great bun, great steak fries.  This will be on my regular rotation for a good burger, though hopefully I can try things others have mentioned if I can be swayed away from the burger!
Breakfasts are good. Service is attentive. Waking for them to reopen. Hope that they change the coffee vendor. With all of the great coffee roasters in town, they shouldn't have lackluster coffee. Rated as 3 due to the coffee.
Horrible! Only two waiters. Ran out of meat?! Too expensive. Had to get up and get our own coffee/juice. If I could take stars away I would. Save your time and money; eat at home. Or mcdonalds.
Only had the country fried steak. Had to say it's been pretty good every time. Large portions. Usually order to go.
went for breakfast, cute but the food was awful. Honestly, Dennys serves better breakfast and I abhor chain restaurants. I really wanted this local place to be great. disappointed.
In spite of the Malayan curse and being a victim of an untimely conflagration in it's building, this gem is officially reborn and doing wonderful things once again!  As many of you know, Ranch House re-opened its doors last Monday, and today Peggy and I had the absolute pleasure of having breakfast there. The food is superb, as always, and the service is excellent.  Chicken-fried steak (either with cream gravy or with green pork chili) is wonderfully favorable and not just breading. The burritos are always top notch.  It is a pleasure to welcome back this neighborhood place!
= = = = = =  REOPENED!  = = = = = =

After closing due to a fire way back on November 1, 2010, Ranch House here finally reopened recently!  They just got their new sign up on the building Thursday but they were already back to being roaring busy without it!     :-)
Service is good and friendly also.  Each of us got a personal greeting when we walked in the door.

We went with a 4-person lunch crew, and we ALL liked EVERYTHING we ordered.

The fried fish was crispy and flaky-tender.  Onion rings, we could smell the beer batter.  Potato salad made in house.  Pastrami and cheese sammich was a winner.  Green chili burro was good, but the "red chile" bowl that came with it was even better.

Portion sizes are a good value and taste is even better.

If you are in the area, you should stop by and give these nice ladies some business - we need more places like this to stick around !!

P.S.  Corrected info.
I was so excited to eat at the Ranch House after their reopening. During the 30+ mile drive one way to the restaurant from my house (I WAS a dedicated customer), I raved about the food to a friend who had joined me. Unfortunately within 5 minutes of sitting down, I realized it was not how I remembered.  The service was HORRIBLE and the staff did not communicate to one another. I ordered the chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy. Apparently they ran out of biscuits (how does that happen in a restaurant who is known for their biscuits?). The server also got our order completely wrong and instead of correcting the order, she disagreed with us and said we made the mistake. No refills on drinks, a simple order that took 40 minutes to come from the kitchen, chewy chicken, barely warm gravy, a very unappetizing buckwheat pancake that was recommended and substituted for the biscuits, and a server who argues....way to go Ranch House. Oh the kicker....another server noticed our frustration and offered to take my iced tea off the order. As we were paying our bill the OWNER asked how was everything. I simply replied "not as I remembered." The server who took my iced tea off the order walked up and told the owner what an experience we had. His response was "hope you come back again." 
I was so disappointed in this dining experience as well as the owner's lack of regard for our experience. They have definitely lost a very devoted customer.
So badly wanted this place to work out, because of the proximity to the house, but it just didn't fare out as much as I hoped O_O womp womp. I need consistency in the restaurants I visit, and after a couple of visits, Ranch House Grille got progressively dissapointing.

First visit: we ordered the half order of the chicken fried steak breakfast and the fried chicken and waffles. Yum! Loved that the half order was perfectly proportioned and at $7, perfect price. This visit topped it off and made us want to come back the next weekend. 

Second visit: womp. womp. womp. This visit may have been a bad day for the chef because not only did they have to recook our chicken (leading to a really long wait) but the biscuits and gravy order was just not appetizing at all. The biscuits were so dense that after a while, it was actually tiring to chew!

So I don't know.. I need more Arcadia/East Phoenix brunch options.
The best chicken fried steak.  I recommend it with the chili verde gravy.  The prices are good and the service is excellent.  I am so glad that they came back after the fire!!
We went back for the first time since they reopened after the fire and had an exceptional lunch.  Chicken fried steak for one and fried chicken for the other.  Both were more than substantial in size and flavor.  The service was great..  It is nicer inside than it used to be.  Can't wait to go back!!
If my neighbors, Joe and Craig (like you care what their names are) hadn't discussed this place in my presence, I wouldn't be here today.
I ordered the huevos rancheros, and my husband ordered the steak and eggs.
He loved his breakfast so much that he barely spoke. 
I loved my breakfast. And I mean, loved it. 
Out of a sense of duty, i offered the hubby a bite, and luckily, he was too busy devouring his steak and eggs, thus declining..
My huevos rancheros had perfectly cooked (over well) eggs on top of corn tortillas. On top? A delicious pork green chili that was to-die-for delish. In addition, you get rice and beans, AND hash browns! 
Yummy, yummy, yummy! 
The place is darling, very comfortable and has very nice personnel that are will to please. 
We've already been back, and it was just as good the second time as it was the first!
This place is a winner!!!
Ok the price for 2 for breakfast was over $27.00 without tip. The eggs were not cooked correctly runny when should have been firm. The chicken fried steak was ok not great. Biscuits doughy in the middle. Sausage grave just ok. Will not be going back anytime soon. The service was ok but the food was not really great.
We rolled into Ranch House Grille at ten o'clock on a Saturday, hoping that the wait for breakfast would not be too long.  There were five of us, and it was just the standard family get-together.  The wait was not too long, only about ten minutes, before we had a table and menus.  This is not typical, I think we just got lucky.

The Ranch House has been a favorite with us for years, we've eaten at the Page restaurant as well as the Phoenix restaurant, which recently re-opened after a too-long remodelling hiatus.  Apparantly, there were some issues with the old building, code requirements and kitchen equipment, but happily for all, it has been resolved, and the Ranch House is back in action in the same building, essentially the same dining room, but now with a front door added.  There is also a nice, covered, vine-shaded patio with a couple of tables.  This time of year, too hot for me.

Amazingly, I've never had the green-chile CF steak.  This was the day to change that.  Ordered my eggs Over-medium and please bring a big glass of iced tea.  The wife had Huevos Rancheros, D1 had oatmeal with strawberries, D2 had a French-Dip and MIL had a turkey sandwich.  Yes, indeed, they serve anything off the menu anytime of day.

People have raved about the Green Chile and I've waited so long, my expectations were pretty high.  Fortunately, I was not disappointed.  I think the Chile could have been hotter, but that's a personal preference.  It was a savory, flavorful sauce, with chunks of tender and tasty pork.  This sauce was draped over a decent-sized portion of Chicken-Fried Steak and topped with a small pile of melting cheddar cheese.  The steak had a nice breading, still crispy, yet the meat was tender and easy to chew.   The eggs were slightly over-cooked, but the yolk was still perfectly runny, they just had a tough, brown edge that says the fire was too hot.  Hash browns were browned and crispy and this came with a side of toast, I had Rye.  The toast was your basic plain bread, nothing to brag about.  

The wife was not so impressed with her dish, she is vegetarian, and said the green chile had too much pork/pork flavoring, the rice was flavorless and the beans tasted like pork.  Her eggs were cooked perfectly and she enjoyed the house-made salsa.  D2, as usual only ate half of her French-Dip sandwich, and so dad got to finish it.  I didn't try the Au Jus, but the beef was tasty and tender, with a bit of melted Provolone on a soft French roll.  I had it as leftovers, zapped in the astro-chef and slathered with mayonnaise.  It was tasty.

Everybody else seemed to like their food, and the young male waiter enjoyed flirting awkardly with D1, who pretty much just rolled her eyes.  The iced tea was good, service was acceptable, not exceptional, but we were not ignored.  Their prices have gone up, but it's still a good value.
This morning, I was on a date with 'self'.  I was in between clients and had a good 2.5 hours to spare and I was starving after my 3 hour massage session.  

The Ranch House Grille is a homey place and the waiters are very attentive even before you are seated!  This morning was no different.  The waiter was so friendly, I thought he was going to ask me out, which was not an issue.  Friendliness over moodiness any day!

I have been about a dozen or so times with my clients to this country bit of a cafe in the Arcadia/Biltmore area.  The eggs are always fresh yet the coffee isn't worth a bean ~ AND I LOVE COFFEE!  I adore steak and eggs and the steak is less than moovelous ; -(    SOOO, I'll try the pancakes next time.  I like to stay in my neighborhood when I go out to eat, it will be worth another shot!
Went today to use our Amazon Deal coupon.  Since the place was busy and there was a waiting line, the hostess offered the option to sit at the counter.  We gladly accepted since we often find the service at the counter a step above table service.  We weren't disappointed.  Our waitress as very friendly and rountinely checked in with us during our meal.  

Wife and I love steak and eggs so we both ordered the smaller 8oz portion.  In addition I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy for .75.  We got three eggs cooked perfectly, mine sunnyside up and the wife's basted.  Each platter (yes I said platter) had a large portion of golden hash browns, and two, not one cut of perfrectly cooked steak to order.  Not since our days in CHicago had we seen such a generous portion of steak on a plate.  The biscuits were just average at best, more like a dinner roll but the sausage gravy was the best I've had in the valley since we have been here,

Bottomline, this is the first time my wife has asked for a to go box for her steak.  She was stuffed as was I.  In fact we were so stuffed that on way home we decided to change our dinner plans to only a light salad!!!!
Seven of us met for breakfast today, and I didn't hear one complaint from my party.  We showed up at 9:30 and were seated within 5 minutes.  I was a little hesitant, reading the negative reviews for this place, but left pleasantly surprised.

I'm not sure if they changed out their biscuits (based on previous reviews), but my friend who ordered them, complimented their biscuits and gravy.  I ordered the huevos rancheros with green chile, and loved it.  The dish came with rice, beans and hash browns.

Good job RHG!
I absolutely love the Ranch House!  Even when I have to wait to be seated, it is worth it.  The food is consistently excellent (especially the chicken fried steak)!  I also sincerely appreciate the always friendly customer service.
Used a Living Social coupon for my first meal at Ranch House Grille; I will be back.  The place is adorable, the service warm and efficient, and the food excellent.  Mom had liver and onions and oozed happiniess with every bite.  I had the chicken fried steak and was not disappointed.  The portions are huge, the quality of the food high, and the flavors excellent.   Look forward to trying it for breakfast.
I love this place!!! Its 5am and Im up and ready to head there in about an hour. The food is home cooking at its finest. I love the service and the country fried chicken.
I went for the first time last week. The service is awesome! They were right on top of water and coffee refills, and the waitress couldn't have been friendlier. I had the bacon and eggs, hash browns and multi grain toast.  Tasted great, with good portions. I'll be back!
Ranch house rocks so does the service!
We were searcing for a yummy breakfast place.  Yelp* to the rescue again.  We were able to be seated immeediately.  The decor is not moderate or chic but homey.  They offer smaller portions of breakfast favorites like chicken fried steak.  It was great, tender and just the right size.  The chorizo breakfast burrito was nice and spicy.  Overall, worth every penny.
They were certainly packing in the customers on a Sunday morning, but that didn't stop us from being seated almost immediately.  Waitservice was rapid and pleasant.  My wife ordered the waffle and eggs benedict.  She was happy (not overjoyed) with the eggs--which I thought were PHENOMENAL--excellent hollandaise sauce.  She was overjoyed with the waffle, which I thought was great.  I had Chicken Fried Steak with eggs and silver dollar pancakes.  The steak was great, gravy was tasty, and the pancakes were at least 6 inches in diameter--which pleasantly surprised me, as I was expecting them to be a lot smaller.  They tasted really great as well.  We left full (but not exploding) for $30 plus tip.  All in all, a good experience and we'll defintely be back!!!
Generally, I am NOT a breakfast person, but I LOVE this place.  

Pros:  Good Service, seating quickly, good time,  always taken care of .  They definitely do know the meaning of Customer Service! Always greeted right away, not too long of a wait, etc...

Cons:  my husband is not a fan of the biscuits here.  He thinks that they are more like dinner rolls than biscuits.  The juice leaves a weird after taste in my mouth, I don't know what that is, it's almost kind of 'soapy' 

The chicken fried steak is better than good!
She planned for us to go here for sunday brunch! I was thoroughly surprised that she planned it here. Her backing was that its a "hole-in-the-wall local" place like how I like it. I was like sure lets give it a try. 

It took them 20 minutes to seat us, as it was busy and too cold & windy to sit outside. The service was good and people amiable. It was a typical breakfast place, right from pancakes, omlettes, salads, burgers, burritos, etc. 

Had a few veggie options, like a typical breakfast place. I got the avacado and black bean patty omelette. Check pix. Havta say didn't like the patty since it was soy based (like BOCA) and not a black bean garden based. I got a side of the southwestern hash browns and a French toast, both were good as well. 

All said and done, no particular reason I havta go back to this place when there are places like Mimi's and lolo's. it's a small place with good people and decent food at almost the same price as other places.
Huge portions, great service, clean, confortable surroundings all welcomed me today to the Ranch House Grille.   

I ordered the chicken fried steak with Homemade Pork Chili Verde $10.  Normally I would never in a million years order this, as I have stopped ordering chicken fried steak years ago because nobody makes it right.  After being talked into trying it, it arrived on my table and OMG, it is the BEST!  Tender, crispy steak with a perfect Chili Verde.  The breakfast also came with 2 eggs and a huge portion of hash browns.  

Definately recomended.
Nice, comfy, clean ... good food - had the grilled chicken salad in a taco bowl - lots of chicken & the chicken was actually WARM!
Had to try this out! YAY, now I have a new place for breakfast & lunch. Got the Chicken Fried Steak breakfast with scrambled eggs, only problem, got the Chicken Fried Steak with chorizo and scrambled egg whites...but now I have a new favorite addiction!!! The biscuits were okay, just not tasty enough for me. Might be good with honey. Got a sample of the pork chile verde, know why it gets awards for it. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.
We were out driving around and came upon this place. Checked the Yelp reviews which were good so we stopped for bkfst. Excellent portions and very reasonable prices. We were fortunate to have been able to sit outside and while we were out there we kept hearing honking..Well, I guess the sign on the street said "honk if you love chicken fried steak"! I guess it's pretty well loved...very good food and service!
I don't think I have ever EVER given a 5-star review before.  Let that sink into your head before I tell you about Ranch House.

I visited Scottsdale for Memorial weekend this year.  On our first morning there, my partner and I had just finished a little morning hike at Papago and decided that we should have some brunch.  We found this gem thanks to Yelp.

This place is a straight-up no nonsense down home cafe.  There's country music playing faintly in the background and it's the kind of place that probably has a lot of regulars.  It's seat-yourself style so you just go in and pop a squat at a table.

I have been to some pretty spectacular "world-class" famous restaurants here in LA, but Ranch House had the best waitress I have ever encountered.  A friendly young girl came over and introduced herself (think her name was Ashley) and this girl is seriously the best waitress I've ever had, and like I said I've eaten at Michelin star places.

At Ranch House, you pretty much just order how many eggs you want and what kind of meat you want.  Everything comes with hash browns and then either toast, pancakes or biscuits n gravy.  Ashley informed us that her favorite was the biscuits n gravy so we of course had to take her up on them.

I got bacon and my partner got the 8 oz steak.  He ordered it rare, because he likes medium rare but places usually cook things too well from what you say so he was assuming it would actually come out medium rare.

Well, it didn't, it came out straight-up rare and all cold in the middle.  I know this is totally all his fault for ordering it rare.  Ashley brought it out and immediately read his mind.  She asked if he really wanted it that rare or if he wanted it taken back to be thrown on for a few minutes--he obliged her and it came back PERFECTLY medium rare.  We both proceeded to feel dumb, btw.

Anyway, my bacon was floppy and thick-cut and I loved it.  The scrambled eggs were perfect.  The hash browns were some of the best I've ever had.  Loved every single thing about the meal.  Even their coffee here is brewed stuff and was a perfect wake-me-up after an early morning hike in the desert.  They put cucumber and lemon in the ice water which I liked as well.

Ashley was so patient, so attentive and did every single thing asked of her perfectly.

For a $25 bill I tipped Ashley $20 and left her a thank you note.  She earned it.

So we came back a second time just before we hit the road to leave Scottsdale and come back to LA.  This time we had an older lady with short hair who was also amazing.  The waitstaff here really cares about the restaurant and really cares about their jobs.  Once again my food was cooked perfectly.  This time the partner tried an omelette and it was seriously GINORMOUS.  For $10, he got an enormous omelette (which I'm pretty sure contained an ENTIRE avocado) and biscuits & gravy.  What a good deal.

Anytime in the future I come back through the Phoenix metro, I'm probably going to make it a point to go out of my way to eat here.

Like I said, I've never given a 5-star review before, but Ranch House TOTES earned it.
I've lived within walking distance for almost seven years but yesterday morning was my first visit to the Ranch House. I had received a $5 off coupon in the mail so I decided to check it out.

I was expecting it to smell of smoke from the recent building fire next door, but there wasn't even a trace of it. (The RH was closed for about 6 months after the fire.) I found a seat by a window, sat down and was greated by the waitress. I ordered an orange juice, one egg over medium (the waitress helped me order my eggs cooked just the way I like them) with buttered toast. I substituted the hash browns for a fruit cup.

Everything was great and almost free after my coupon! Next time I'll bring my Kindle to read while I dine. I might even bring Peekaboo when it cools off outside because I noticed a couple with a Great Dane sit down at a table on the outside patio. Dog friendly? It must be.
I am not a food critic, I am more of a traveling foodie.  So, from the reviews & comments asserting this restaurant has the best chicken fried steak & green chili in Phoenix, that did not hold true for me.  The food was not bad but not great. The combination omelet I had was quite good. The hash browns were ok but the oil used to fry them tasted old. The pancakes were just ok.  The service was friendly. You get the atmosphere a decent local establishment that certainly has its following. They make their own hot sauces which I tasted.  We went to try some place new. I am glad we did but it was a drive. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back anytime soon.
I went here for breakfast a few days ago with my mom and sister.

My mom had been wanting to try it for some time. It's a nice place, very open floor plan, with Native American art pieces hanging on the wall.

It's a seat your self kind of place.

The food was good. They serve the usual breakfast items. Our waitress was really nice. But the service was slow. 

The place was about half full, so maybe that had something to do with it. I believe I just saw the one waitress going around to everyone. 

I liked it! I'll come back for sure!
I took my husband here for breakfast for his birthday. It was very good! I had the huevos rancheros and the green chile pork was delicious! The rest of it was good too. My husband had bacon and eggs and he said it was good. The staff was friendly and we were served quickly. We'll definitely go again
Definitely worth the money.  I ate the meat for two more days it was that big.
My husband and I LOVE this place for breakfast.  Their "Green Chili Gravy Chicken Fried Steak" is fantastic!  The ambiance is "corner cafe" style... the breakfast fabulous.  Not sure about other meals, but breakfast is worth a try.
Ranch House Grille has quickly become my favorite breakfast spot.  Everything is from scratch and tastes homemade.  I love that the menu has a good variety.  You can get serious and order country fried steak with biscuits and gravy or something on the lighter side like yogurt, fruit and granola.  I think the pricing is fair.  You definitely won't leave hungry.  LocalDines.com generally offers a $10 for $20 deal.  I highly recommend Ranch House Grille!
Down home comfort food! This has become a favorite for our friends & family when then come to visit from the midwest. The best biscuits & gravy I've had in Phoenix. Super friendly staff.
Love the chicken fried steak.  I will have to say it's the best in the valley.  Service was wonderful.  I have no complaint and I will be back very soon.
Hello, we love your place but was wondering why you do not serve the minced bacon or minced ham on your menu any more? It is the best ever! Please bring it back!!! Thank you.
Green chili pork, chicken fried steak.  Nothing else needs yo be said!
Awesome food and Great service...a must try ....
sometimes you just want to go to an old fashioned country style restaraunt and order some biscuits n gravy and don't need all the over the top fixins some of the other places put (hint hint: snooze putting carrots in their gravy realllllyyyyy?!?!?!?!) in their dishes. the place serves generous size portions and I am a fan!
ranch House Grille use to be one of my favorite places to go for breakfast. However I was very disappointed this past weekend with not only the service but with the food. We went there for breakfast we sat and waited at a table for at least 10 minutes, I almost started to leave and then the waitress appeared and apologized for the delay, she was patient as we ordered but the food took a long time , I understand them being busy, so we were patient. The food came out I ordered poached eggs, a buckwheat pancake and dry toast, the toast was coated with butter so I asked them to remake a new toast which they did, the pancake was okay,but a little dry but editable so I ate that, no syrup was brought to the table no waitress either so I hunted around and found some packs of honey for our pancakes. Now to my eggs they were either porches hard or they were poached correctly and sat under light and got hard. None the less they were rubbery and so bad I could not eat them, the waitress was more than happy to have them make me new ones but I lost my appetite and she did take them off the bill as I could not eat them. My friends eggs were scrambled a little dry overlooked but his were edible.  I hate to complain but this was the worst meal that I have ever had there, I hate to say but I need to find a new favorite ,as I probably won't come back. I gave it 2 stars as the waitress really tried to do the best she could and you do get big portions for the money but quality has surly suffered.
Driven by this place for years and it is always too busy to stop . . . today . . . not many cars, so I thought I would take a chance . . . I thought to myself before I got out of the car . . . either this place has gotten really bad . . . due the lack of cars . . . OR . . . It is my lucky day.

IT WAS MY LUCKY DAY

Service was great . . . my waitress recommended the meatloaf sandwich special . . . and I was skeptical . . . meatloaf with grilled onions and barbeque sauce on grilled sour dough . . . I died and went to heaven . . . Fries were hot crispy and great with the barbeque sauce that oozed out of the sandwich.

Not only was this place a strong 5 stars . . . but it was a 7 napkin sandwich . . . I will definitely be back . . .
Great place to go for green chili, super tasty!

Also, the omelettes are fantastic, very fresh and good sized portion.

The service was friendly and efficient.
My boyfriend and I went there for breakfast one weekend and were unimpressed. The parking was terrible and service just OK. I ordered the eggs benedict which had the sweetest hollandise sauce and my boyfriend said IHOPs chicken fried steak was better. The server never came back to fill up our drinks and just dropped off the check to never be seen again (pay upfront). Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
Good neighborhood restaurant with homestyle food. I particularly love the fish and chips. It's hard to get that anywhere these days. Love the giant cups of soda the give you with the crushed ice.

Servers and staff are friendly (but see below). The time between ordering and getting your food is good.

I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that they need to work on the attentiveness of their servers. It's hit or miss and the servers don't always come back to check on you enough. I know it's a fine line between not enough service and too much. I think Ranch House is tipping toward the not enough side. I want to emphasize though that servers are very friendly with a great attitude.

Overall, great neighborhood feel. Glad to support a local business. I'll be going back!
For us, this is the best breakfast in Phoenix, and maybe lunch too. Packed with old time regulars who know what they like, this is a throwback cafe with a great menu and even greater food. Don't miss the green chile on anything, I like the pork chop and eggs. M'lady orders hash everywhere it is fresh, and declares theirs a winner
The chicken fried steak here is awesome. The parking is not that great, and there is a small wait. The food and service was worth the wait
The chicken-fried steak topped with green chile pork was phenomenal. It was accompanied by perfect hash browns and two eggs cooked just right to order. Instead of toast we opted for the biscuits and gravy- an amazing upgrade for just 75 cents more. We headed out the door as full as if we just had a Thanksgiving feast. Oh, and we were holding go-cups of the drinks we had with our meals. Excellent service and management at a place that does it right.
Who knew that in downtown historic Glendale, there lived the most adorable little locally owned ice cream parlor called Papa Ed's?

I didn't... until today!

I made the thirty minute drive to Glendale from Old Town this afternoon for a meeting and was lucky enough to get a tour of some of the cutest businesses around town.  Papa Ed's was one of them... 

My friend Danica walked me inside and introduced me Linda, the owner.  For those that aren't lucky enough to have their private tour guide like I was, Papa Ed's is tucked behind the Country Maiden house turned retail store (which happens to be yet another adorable Glendale business that I will review in due time as well).

Papa Ed's carries both Shamrock Farms and Dreyer's ice cream... it reminds me of a smaller, more local "Ben and Jerry's" kind of place.  It's bright, colorful and welcoming...

While I passed on getting an ice cream today, I did take advantage of their outdoor seating; you see, I had a conference call smack dab in the middle of the afternoon.  It was fun to see people go in and out with their ice cream treats.  There's also plenty of beautiful landscaping right outside their door.

Next visit to the area, I'll have to go for an ice cream from Papa Ed's... if you make it there before me, let me know what you think?!
unless you hate ice cream and friendly people you will love Papa Ed's! It's tucked away in Caitlin Court in downtown Glendale.  Walking towards the front you can't help but notice all the love and care that went into the garden and flowers - the flower bed still makes me smile!  Walking through the front door it's easy to forget where and when you are - the wood floors, Vintage coke machine and friendly staff all most made me forget why I was there... ICE CREAM. good selection and great ice cream.. 

Now let's talk about ice cream pie... Papa Ed's makes to order (with advance notice) ice cream pies. I love the Peanut butter cup with Oreo cookie crust. The lemon and Raspberry sorbet swirl in a  graham cracker crust and my Holiday Favorite - Pumpkin Pie Ice Cream in a graham cracker crust!
I had heard about this place but could never find it. It's tucked behind another shop and is very easily missed from the street. 
I love the Old Town Glendale area and Papa Ed's Ice Cream fits in perfectly in the neighborhood. Everything about Papa Ed's is charming and you can tell that a lot of love and care has been put into this ice cream shop. I think it being tucked away behind another shop added to the charm. It was nice to sit outside eating ice cream with two friends away from the hustle and bustle just a few feet away. From the sidewalk until you step into Pap Ed's, the charm  really creates a lot of build up, I felt a bit let down when I saw the variety of ice cream offered.
While the ice cream was tasty, it was kinda of a disappointment that it was the same brand and mostly the same flavors that I can purchase in any grocery store.
I was hoping for some homemade ice cream or at least some unique  flavors or something to mix in like fruit or candy. 
So close Papa Ed's! So close!!
Still a positive rating though!
If you find yourself in downtown Glendale and have a hankering for some Ice Cream, this is the place to go.  It is right in the heart of things, in a wonderfully renovated little square of merchants.  As you walk down the long sidewalk to the entrance, with plenty of arrows and pictures of ice cream cones to guide your way, you will feel as though you are stepping back in time.  Once inside, you will be greeted by the extremely warm and hospitable staff.  The inside is a cute little shop offering about a dozen flavors of ice cream to choose from, as well as a few old-fashioned candies.  There are a few small tables inside, but there are plenty of other seating options and open space in the courtyard that surrounds this and the other neighboring shops.   The prices are extremely reasonable, so even if you are just walking by on your way to another destination, you can easily stop by and get your ice cream fix and be on your way to your destination in no time, without spending more than the spare change in your front pocket.
Great little place in Downtown historic glendale. This is our hangout for ice cream especially in their garden. It's very refreshing to see and feel like you are back in time . No drama , no traffic, just friendly customers service and great ice cream.
Like another reveiwer said, i was hoping for some homemade icecream.
They offer a couple of brand ice creams and thats it. Nothing special.
It is a really neat location in downtown Glendale and the lady is really nice.
I think they should atleast offer a few homemade ice cream options and see how it goes and weed out the brand stuff :-(
Wow!  I finally found an oasis in the desert.  A couple of scoops of the Papa Ed's hand scooped ice cream and the heat wasn't a problem anymore.  A great throwback for us who remember old fashion ice crem stores.  I must have spent an hour sitting while looking at all the pictures of the staff on the walls and reading about the charitable accomplishments the store owner has done with Glendale and the surrounding community. We weren't familiar with the area since we were from out of town and so the owner was kind enough to talk to us about the local business and what to see.  What an enjoyable afternoon because the staff is so kind, the atmosphere is friendly and especially the ice cream was delicious.
My boyfriend stopped in here after lunch last week, it was a typical hot AZ summer day and we were both in the mood for something cool. We love downtown Glendale and all the little shops so we decided to stop in for a cool treat. Cute little shop, nice staff, good ice cream, what else can you ask for!
Papa Eds is a friendly local Ice cream shop that will treat you like family. Located in a unique shopping are of Glendale with great little shops. They have special treats and unique flavors for everyone, even special cones for littles ones!
I think this location is way cool and the atmosphere is from the 50's but the ice cream was just Dryers and Shamrock.  I was wishing it was homemade since it would fit the ambiance.  This is a small house behind another that have both been converted to businesses in downtown Glendale.  We went out of our way to support this business since we were at the Chocolate Affair and did not want to just give the money to a temporary vendor in the area.
Best hidden secret on the valley!  Nostalgia, sweet treats, fun flavors & a perfect garden to host kids parties.  Extra points cuz they're pet friendly :)
This is the cutest ice cream shop ever! I love going in here and trying their new creations. My husband and daughter also love the choices. I think it is amazing that they are so creative. Their newest edition-the fairy house out front is adorable and I think my daughter could have looked at it for hours! Great scenery and amazing treats!
This place is adorable!! From the quaint decor, painted ice cream path and friendly staff to the delicious ice cream... This ace is totally worth going to!!

I love love love the cappuccino splatter ice cream and the pumpkin!!

Also with the check in deal- what more could we ask for?
I like being a tourist in my own city from time to time. I think walking around the local downtown Glendale shops gives me that vavcation feel, especially on a comfotably warm day in February. 

Papa Ed's had been on my bookmarked list of things to try for a while and this day just seemed so perfect to finally go for a visit.

The location is just so cute. They have a small garden in the front yard of the house and the whole atmosphere is just very charming.

The ice cream itself was very tastey. I think they only sell Shamrock Farms ice cream, which is although not made in house but is at least supporting another local business.
Let's just start with 75 cent kids cones and COOKIE ICE CREAM SANDWICHES! Must try, especially when they have macaroons!

Papa Ed's puts you in a different mindset. It is tucked behind another shop and has the most beautiful garden. Sweet peas, Jasmine, Mint, Carrots... So on and so forth.

Papa Ed's had added drinks, including Coffee, the BEST Iced Coffee, and loose leaf teas. They have like 20 flavors.

They have 16 flavors of Ice Cream. Half of the freezer is Karens Kreamery which is a local creamery that makes unique flavors like Monster Cookie, Cappuccino Splatter, Caramel Toffee Crunch!! And the rest is a mix of Dreyer's/Shamrock Farms Classic Flavors.

Bring the kids. Bring the family, and feel like you are at home.

Linda, the owner, is so sweet and she truly is what makes the shop feel so full of love and childhood!!

They also make homemade waffle cones/bowls.

Sugar Free/Fat Free/Gluten Free/Dairy Free Options which is awesome!!
Really neat place hidden in the back of the 1920's bungalow called The Country Maiden  in the Catlin Court Historic District in downtown Glendale. They have a nice selection of ice cream, and the courtyard is very relaxing. 
Here is a couple of tips, They carry Karen's Kreamery ice cream and Frosty Paw frozen treats for your dog!
I never knew they were here, glad I found them on yelp!
This is one of the small business I been wanted to try and today is the day that I finally got the chance to, it's a house that had been converted to a business, the ice cream store is behind the house, it's a neat little place to hang out in a hot Arizona day, would be really awesome and busy in the summer time. I'm really happy with the visit and looking forward to coming back soon. But one thing is I thought since they are a small business they would make their own ice cream but it's shamrock which isn't bad either. And you could also reserve for a party or a big group.
I have been here once but they are close and today I got opportunity to check them out, they're right at down town Glendale, can be easily missed because its a house but also a ice cream place which is located in the back of the house, Papa Ed's Ice Cream is a nice, cool and fun place to be, there are outdoor seats that is nicely shaded and cool which would be perfect for the summer time. They also take party request like birthdays or group events. The ice cream are very tasty which are from shamrock but the waffle corns are homemade which is the best. I'll be back again and will bring my little cousins and family.
Get ready, Vegas!  Your taste buds are going to thank you.  Whether you prefer your chicken baked, fried or grilled, you can't go wrong! 

I prefer the fried variety. Juicy, flavorful tender strips lightly battered and sooo crispy!  They have a huge selection of sauces for any taste.  I like the house sauce myself.  Add to that crispy golden fries and a slice of garlic toast.  Nomnom! 

The owners are friendly and real pros with chicken flavor!  These guys rock!  Plus I'm lucky to have my Sign-A-Rama shop only a couple doors down from them (shamelss self-promotion).

The grilled strips are also A plus.  Tasty and a healty alternative to the fried variety.  

Bring the gang and chow down on some good stuff.  Better than any chain chicken in the world.  5 stars.  KF WHO????
More of a 4.5. BFG is GOOD chicken! get ready for me to say "really good" 100 times.

(Full disclosure: I know the owners/chefs, but that won't make me go twice in a week. The FOOD makes me go back 2x!)

Portion sizes are plenty! The meals are $5.75, I think, and that is 4 strips, plenty of fries/sides with dipping sauces. Here's what we've had:

Grilled Chicken is juicy and has a very nice, fresh yet mild marinade. The quality of the chicken seem higher than grilled chicken you get at KFC or other fast foods.

Fried Chicken is panko-breaded which is a great switch from the norm, and just as juicy as the grilled chicken. If you want a fuller meal, go for these! My husband thinks this portion size borders on large. I don't love fried food, because I tend to feel the grease in my mouth for hours (cough cough, CANES). But these are fresh and leave the plate dry! No grease there. Super good.

The french fries are super good. They are the kind of fries that have that texture like they've been rolled in a batter, on the skinny side, with just enough salt to make them irresistible.

The grilled veggies (zucchini or squash, onions, roma tomatoes) are a point of contention for me. I thought they tasted great (they seem to be lightly marinated in the same sauce as the grilled chicken), but the cuts of veggies were on the small side. That is a personal preference for me, though. I would rather have a crunchy bite of zucchini in there still. 

THE DIPS: Oh Em Gee!!
BFG rounds out their high-quality chicken with amazing, freshly made (I think they are homemade?!) dips that range from regular to wacky.

Honey Mustard like I used to get in the south! you can see the mustard seeds in there! I loved it with the fries and fried ckn.

BFG sauce is good, it seems to be something like a soy with a thicker base, with a little sweetness and seasonings? I can't figure it out, but its really good on the grilled chicken.

Wasabi Cream! Nice Choice BFG. Talk about something different and very good! Its not overly strong (maybe they could offer a dollop of wasabi so you can change the strength? I like wasabi A LOT), its a wonderful change to a world of ketchup/ranch.

Sweet Chili is another welcome change. if you like a little heat, mixed with a little sweet, this is for you!

The only dip I didn't love is the Ranch, but that's another personal thing. I love buttermilk Hidden Valley Ranch (hey! i'm a southern girl) and no other. and this isn't that. but with the other dips, I don't mind!

They made me a taste-test of fried mac & cheese balls, if they put that on the menu, get it! it was good (panko breaded too).

All of the meals come with good garlic bread, great friendly service, and its made when you order it. So be prepared to wait about 5 minutes (worth it).

I would think this would be great family stop on a weeknight or a weekend, or good take out (I'm going to try takeout sometime to see how it holds up). The place is small, like probably seats 15 people, but its definitely a place to try. Several times.
I was returning some excess stuff to home depot when I saw a sign that said 'Chicken Strips' -- i thought to myself, chicken strips, all the place does, it better be good. And good for me i felt like chicken so I dropped in to order me some chicken. 

As the name says - baked, fried, grilled. Its simple and simply delicious. I ordered two combos, a baked chicken with baked mac and a grilled chicken with french fries. 

I talked to a cat named Jin and he explained the rundown and history of the joint and talked until the food arrived. The staff is friendly, the place is clean and the food is tasty. 

Each combo comes with a drink and bread, the bread is very tasty and their selection of sauces is very good. I went for the BFG sauce and the wasabi cream sauce while the other combo had bbq and honey mustard.

Everything was tasty, it was cheap, and run by friendly folks. Something is quirky about their logo but it got me to go in.
So I'm just going to put it out there, I know one of the owners, but believe you me if the restaurant sucks, I will say it.  I like this restaurant.  All the food is prepared fresh, made to order except the fries.  I had combo #3 which is 4 grilled chicken strips w/ grilled veggies + garlic bread + a drink.  I added 2 fried chicken strips and had Wasabi Cream + BFG as my sauces, the owner gave me a bonus to try so I tried the sweet chilli + honey mustard.  We all know chicken is chicken.  It's all in the way you prepare it and the sauces.  I really liked the wasabi cream + honey mustard.  All sauces are prepared on site.  It's something different,  worth a try.  Oh and btw, I got all the food I listed above for 7 bucks.  The prices are VERY reasonable. $5.75 for a combo.  It's a mom + pops shop, definitely worth supporting.
Healthy eats for $5.75 (including drink).. *Swoon*! Although I was basically trying to eat "healthy", I tried the grilled, fried, and baked strips (I did it for Yelp - how can I rate a place without trying it all?)! I'm with Ann Marie - the grilled were actually my favorite. They put just enough glaze on them to give them flavor without being overpowering. They were grilled to order (guy threw them on the grill right when I placed my order!) and were so delicious. 

Baked wasn't all that special, but fried were awesome ! No idea how they aren't greasy ? Panko ..mmmm.. so light, so fresh, and so "not fried" tasting. Love it ! 

I was thrilled to death to get 2 skewers of fresh delicious veggies with my chicken (green peppers, onions, tomatoes - yum!). I also tried a plethora of sauces. For you wasabe peeps, you'll love that wasabe cream sauce. My coworker was very pleased to find liquid cheese (like that kind that put on nachos at ballparks!), but I couldn't stop eating the BFG house sauce. It kinda reminds me of In-n-out special sauce, but yummier. 

It's a simple concept, but executed well. A good value, healthy, and delicious !
This place was on my 'To Do List" for a little while. Since I was in the neighborhood I decided to stop by today.  It's kind of difficult to see from the street, so the easiest way to describe the location is that it's in the shopping mall right next to the Home Depot....on the left side if you're facing Home Depot.

Before I entered, I looked on Yelp and saw that they had a Special Offer for $1.50 for Hot Chicks.....decided I would investigate further.

Since this was my 1st visit, I didn't know what a Hot Chick was and was pleased to find out that it was a Fried Chicken strip on a Hot Dog Bun w/Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, and your pick of sauce.  This sounded like a winner....so I ordered 2.....one with their BFG Sauce and the other with Honey Mustard.  For a side, I ordered Baked Mac 'n Cheese.

The restaurant is a small business owned and operated by a couple of friends and their family members.  While I waited for my food, we chatted it up a while.  They are genuinely nice people, which is a huge plus for me.  They asked each and every person who came into the joint what their first name was and called them by their first name when calling the order and saying goodbye....and it doesn't sound fake either.

After a few minutes my food was ready.  I decided to try the Hot Chick with the BFG Sauce first.  The proportion of Lettuce/Tomato/Onions was just right and the amount of Sauce on the Sandwich was just right as well.  The Chicken was moist and tasty....it wasn't greasy (bonus)....it was like a Chicken Strip Hot Dog....awesome!  The BFG Sauce is sort of like Thousand Island Dressing, but with a slightly different flavor to it....definitely worth a try.

While I was devouring the 1st Hot Chick, I took a few bites from the Mac 'n Cheese....it was gooey and Cheesy....it's making my mouth water just thinking about it.  The Mac 'n Cheese portion size is pretty good too for $1.50.  I then went for the 2nd Hot Chick....covered in Honey Mustard Sauce....again, it was explosion of awesome in my mouth!  The Honey Mustard wasn't too sweet and balanced the flavors of the Chicken and the other toppings.

Overall, it was a good day.....2 Hot Chicks & a Side of Mac 'n Cheese for around $5...isn't that every guy's dream?  Shh!!!  Don't tell my Wife!  Ha!

Will I return?  There are so many other options on the menu I want to try....Grilled Chicken, Baked Chicken, and the Fries...You bet I will!
After seeing peter's review and the offer for the hot chicks i stopped in for lunch and got four of these bad boys for the office. They are amazingly good and simple all at once. and for the price of 1.50 each I was super happy.  Its in a hotdog bun with lettuces and onions, a nice long piece of fried chicken and a couple slices of tomatoes covered in a sauce of your choice. A much better alternative to the hotdog. Amazingly tasty and kind of freaky that its so tasty :)
Great food, excellent value. Highly recommend.
this place is freakin awesome.  run by asians it seems.  very flexible with order.  i got two veggie skewers, a ton of tasty grilled chicken, and rice, for only like 7.50.  i will def come back again.  friendly staff.

Only negative is that it's a little bit difficult to find.  just look for the big orange HOME DEPOT sign on the left, if you're heading north on rainbow.

i just finished eating the meal and it was amazing.
I like Raising Cane's, its close to school and home, drive thru available, always hot, and the toast.. sometimes I go there just for the toast, but thats the problem. I can't be going to my chicken finger spot and only looking forward to the toast. 

Nooooow... lets pretend I am married to Raising Canes then.. BFG would be my mistress, cheap, hidden, ultra friendly, gives more than receives, and satisfies. Since I've cheated it would only be fair that I compare my lover and my new mistress. 

Raising Cane's Box Combo (6.89) versus BFG anything (5.75). 

The drink
- Both locations offer similar drinks, coke, diet coke, orange fanta, sprite, and etc.. so thats a tie . 

The dip
- Canes has ketchup and that brown gravy cane's sauce. BFG has 8 dipping sauces (guessing here), from a range of sweet honey mustard to the wassabi cream that brings a little spice to your life. My mathematical logarithms are not so good contrary to stereotypical beliefs but I know that BFG sauces (insert greater than sign) Cane's.  

The side
- At Cane's you can only get crinkled fries, a little cup of cole slaw, the delicious toast and... thats it. BFG offers you baked mac and cheese, vegetable skewers, garlic bread from a baguette and shoe string fries. If it wasn't for Cane's having that beautiful master piece of toast then they would have been completely dominated instead of mostly dominated by BFG. 

EL POLLO (CHICKEN)
- Cane's crispy chicken reminds me of what any other place that offers fried chicken strips would be like, but BFG's fried chicken is more.. homey, its a mostly unified and equally crispy deep fry of moist addicting chicken. BFG other offerings are grilled and baked, my favorite, which is seasoned and juicy. Sorry Cane's but you gave me no choice (literally) thus checkmate by BFG. 

Oh there is also a grilled chicken salad which I have yet to try since I am not too fond of salads.

It is a bit difficult to find it you aren't familiar with the area, which is somewhat fine for me since its my secret mistress anyways. I also would like to see some more tables, seems to have a lot of free space in the little shop.
The staff is super awesome. They make an effort to learn your name and a few things about you. Customer service sets an example for all the other places in Vegas.

The food itself is decently priced. The breading on the chicken is light and crispy with a juicy inside. Grilled veggies were seasoned nicely and weren't overcooked.

Sweet tea is quite nice. 

Overall i can see myself coming back here quite often
I cant think of a better place to dip my (chicken)breasts strips other than here .

I ordered #1, which came with the grilled chicken, baked mac & cheese, a slice of garlic bread and my choice of two sauces; the traditional ranch and fell utterly in-love with the wasabi cream. 

I created a survey, in which every single taste bud agreed to "yum" after my first bite. I had a mini chem lab at my table(two ramekins of sauces)where I mixed my wasabi sauce with the ranch. Supa- dupa tasty.

Jin, one of the nice owners took care of me and the bf, was very social as he talked about anything and everything. kept it real chill like cardigan weather. he talked quite a lot as we waited for our food, but i appreciate it when owners get to know their customers. makes time go by fast and smoothly, and very memorable.

and best for last, their baked mac & cheese. i savored each bite, so delicious, i forgot the name of this joint, and might have offended the chicken's ego a little. just a little. i even accused my bf of taking my last piece of chicken, when it was really i who, unconsciously, ate it. it's that good.
This must be where the chicken falls in love with the side dishes. Baked chicken with baked sides, fried chicken with fried sides and grilled chicken with grilled sides. I'm telling you, it's a triple date.

Me and my BF tried it out. He got the baked couple which came with a side of baked mac&cheese. Mine was panko breaded chicken deep fried with a side of fries. Every order comes with garlic bread and your choice of 2 sauces out of 9. My choices were the BFG sauce and the honey mustard. Jin & Tin are an awesome team and great people. There wasn't a second that Jin wasn't serving us. And if he wasn't, he was having a chill conversation and getting to know us personally. I like when places call you by your name instead of a number.

Everything here is simple and delicious. And they always have specials like teriyaki bowls when I was there. If you're craving something chicken, this is a good spot to go.
I knew it!! I knew this spot would be crackin! When me and the gf paid BFG a visit, it was totally random.  You know how you press shuffle on your iPod? And you get a good song that you would gladly listen to? Yeah kinda like that, no skipping. Just let it plaaaaay.

After we ordered, Jin (co-owner) asked for my name.  I thought it was just to call it out for the order, but no, he took a mental note and made conversation with us.  Even though we met just seconds ago, we talked like we were homies.  That's hella cool. Shout out to Jin! I got your back if anyone gives you problems homie! Lol. Anyways, he kept our drinks filled at all times.

As for the food, I enjoyed it like it was my last meal.  A fork and knife came with my 'Baked' order.  And the chicken was perfectly cooked, with the perfect seasonings.  It came with 'Baked' Mac n' cheese, and a slice of garlic toast. The Mac n cheese was good but tasted like it was missing something. Hmmm, butter. Yeah that'll do the trick. And probably cheddar cheese on top instead of mozzarella.  The sauce selection is real nice, cuz what if you don't want cane sauce or ketchup with your fingers!!!! their sauce called the BFG is really good and I recommend trying it. 

I will be paying BFG alot more visits for the equal reason of the food being excellent and well prepared by Tin, and the super excellent attentive service provided by Jin!
The food is good here, but the customer service is phenomenal! Yes, I said phenomenal. The guy who took our order and served us our food was super attentive, funny, and an overall awesome person! My friend's car died because she left her headlights on and he jumped her car for her! :) That's customer service baby! :P

On to the food... I ordered the baked chicken strips and tasted the fried chicken strips. The winner is FRIED CHICKEN! Doesn't it always win? The mac & cheese is creamy just the way I like. They had many sauces to choose from, but I'm not a sauce person so I just chose whatever.

Note: This place isn't big at all and the seating is limited to about 20 people total. 

I will be back... I wish they had a drive-thru!
great food, great service, will return simply on there hospitality
Someone wrote on Yelp.com, "one person can not rely on the reviews of yelp; the individual must try for themselves and make their own conclusion."  I read the reviews for BFG Chicken Strips and was even inspired with all the reviews made by all the members of Yelp.  I made the suggestion to my boss to eat here for lunch and she happily agreed.  Considering we always order to go, I placed a call for pick up.  Towards of the end of the conversation, the cashier over the phone advised me it would be ready in six minutes.  Whoa!  Wait a minute, I'm about a good 15 minutes away!  He was kind enough to tell the cooks to start cooking six minutes before I arrive.  

Off I went immediately after I hung up the phone.  Almost there I thought, however I got lost.  Who gets lost in Charleston and Rainbow?  Because I couldn't find the place, I made a few u-turns and finally decided to go towards Home Depot.  Yup, there it was hiding next to Home Depot.  That hardware retail store has a way of keeping any small establishments from being seen on Rainbow Road.

Luckily, it wasn't swamped with a ton of people like I thought it would be.  I walked straight in and there were a few people seated and another few lined up to order.  It was awesome how the cashier would talk to each customer as if he's known them for a while.  First names of each customer were said at least three times before they were done ordering.  That's very impressive.  But, that is the difference between a mom and pop's shop and a big corporation fast food chain.  It's more personal.

My boss and I ordered the same lunch, #4, Build Your Own!  We decided to get four fried strips, baked Mac and cheese, garlic bread, two sauces, and regular drink all for $5.75 plus tax.  :D  I was excited to take this back to the office and just devour it as the aroma was teasing me and calling out my name.

As soon as I got back to the office, we sat down and I just delved in as though I hadn't eaten in a month. What can I say?  I love to pig out.  To describe my meal:  A swirl of rainbows just came over me as I bit in to the chicken strip.  The breading was so lightly crisp and the meat was just so tender; the seasoning, was just right.  It didn't even need sauce, but I got the BFG sauce which is like a Thousand Island dressing with more zest to it and Ranch.  Mmmmm... you are just so yummy!  I'm still imagining it right now.  The baked Mac and cheese was heavenly too with gooey cheese of awesomeness!  That garlic bread was one of the best garlic breads I've had with lots of flavor and the right texture when biting in to it.  I'm closing my eyes as I'm typing this and reminiscing Tuesday's lunch.  

My boss even said, "Good call on lunch!"  Yup, I got brownie points that day.  Thank you BFG!  Now I have to figure out what to eat for lunch today.  I hope it'll be equal or top this lunch.
WINNER, WINNER, CHICKEN FINGER!!!!!!   KFC??? nope....Cane's??? not even close....BFG???? DING DING DING DING DING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Jin and his crew have got something for everyone.....

Baked, Fried, or Grilled, the choice is yours on how you want your chicken fingers prepared....So far, I've only  had my fingers fried and those are some tasty katsu fingers!!!!

The sides come BFG'd as well...Baked Mac and Cheese, Fries, or Griled veggie skewers that can be mixed or  matched. Each combo comes with garlic bread, TWO sauces of your choice, AND a drink ...The Wasabi Cream Sauce is my favorite, which tastes exactly like honey mustard slightly infused with wasabi. for $5.75 you seriously can't go wrong....ALOHA!!!
This is a new favorite from my usual Mr. Sandwich lunch spot. I love Mom and pop restaurants because the owners really care about the product they dish out. 

Tin and Jin are the brains to this Asian influenced chicken joint. What's not to love of their fried chicken strips, fries, garlic bread AND a drink for $5.75. That's a steal in my book. The Panko crusted chicken tenders reminds me of a thick Chicken Katsu. The fries are insanely addictive with sweet chilli sauce and wasabi cream sauce so be careful! Also, I do appreciate how the fries remain crispy for extended an extended period of ESPN Sportscenter. 

Next visit baked chicken and mac n cheese.
Great place, great food, great price and super friendly staff. We headed here after visiting the Spring Preserve.  A perfect finish I must say. And our little baby girl loved their chicken...which is why I have to give this place 5 stars. Sophie is very picky with food. She never eats any chicken. We tested it the very next day. I tried to feed her some chicken from Souplantation..Boy was I wrong. She spit it out right away. Awesome BFG! We will definely be back. Even if the drive is a bit further away for us.
Heee...I see you got that Bibimbap special..Heheee..I will put it on my wish list for the next visit...LOL
I've been meaning to come for a long time. I pass by it all the time to/from work and it's either too early or too late.

Jin greets us and like what most Yelpers said asked for our names and asked if it's our first time.

BF and I both got the "Create Your Own" combo with fried strips, mac and cheese and each a wasabi sauce, BFG for me, and sweet chili for him. 

While we were waiting he asks, "are either of you Yelpers?" I thought it was rather curious question but I said "yes". He then explained that it's because he noticed a pattern of ordering that first timers who get what I got tend to be Yelpers because they read what is considered the "best".  On the way there I was reading the reviews and he's right.....and about 10 of the reviews are people I know. Haha. So there- they know youre a Yelper if you're getting the "best of" box. Then he asked about us and told us a bit about himself and Tin. 

The strips were juicy, crispy and not oily at all. I love they have a variety to sauces to suit your mood to dress it up but even alone it was nicely seasoned. I loved the wasabi sauce..a little bit of zing and a bit of sweet. The chili sauce is not that thai chili sauce from the bottle and was tasty with a hit of cilantro in it. BFG has a good tang. Garlic bread has slices of garlic on it. Yay! I kinda eat a lot of garlic so it makes me happy (sorry if I sit next to you while I sweat, haha). Mac and cheese is very cheesy and gooey. I hate when baked gets dry but this had a lot of cheesy goodness. If this was open late then I'd probably never go to Cane's. We only go there because it's fresh and open late. I'll steal my Yelp bestie Angela H.'s word- it's "normalicious". Delicious, doing simple comfort food right. 

As we were sitting there enjoying our food, Jin came to check on us and refill drinks so even though its counter service, they sit wait on peoples tables. We also listened to convos and he greeted a few people coming in by their name. If he remembers everyone that's pretty impressive. 

We'll find out the next time we come in.
(sigh)
Let us pause for a second.........that was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I will forever be converted; I am no longer a Rasing Canes follower.  Well, probably not the whole truth but BFG was off the charts money!!!

Down to the business:
~Both my husband and I ordered the #1:  4 well seasoned, baked chicken strips, baked macaroni and cheese, & garlic toast. Came with a drink and 2 dipping sauces.  Our combined total was $12 and change.
~My brother ordered the same combo but instead of the baked chicken he had the fried.  Sister in law ordered the salad with grilled chicken.  Their total....$12 and change.

Here's why I'm in LOVE....
~The mac 'n' cheese is like creamy YUMMY goodness, and the portion was perfect.  Sometimes I go places and they never give me enough, in this instance I was pleasantly HAPPY!
~Both the baked and panko fried chicken was oh so freakin' AMAZING!  I have never tasted anything like those fried strips before, ever!
~Oh the DIPPY SAUCES......... =)
I can go anywhere and get ranch or honey mustard, so obviously I wanted something more unique in flavor.  I had the WASABI CREAM and SWEET CHILI sauce..........off the charts!!!
~The prices are great!
~The service was on point!
~It's around the corner from my house, so how the hell do you beat that?!?!?

=)

Go there........disappointment will NOT follow!
I am a huge fan of this tiny chicken joint. Any restaurant I can eat at when I am dieting AND when I am not dieting gets bonus points. All combos are under $6 and come with four nicely sized chicken strips, a side, garlic bread, two sauces AND a drink! Everything is made fresh to order which I love. I ordered the #2 because I am not dieting today:) It was Fried Strips with a generous portion of crispy fries(yum). My sauce selection was Ranch and Sweet Chili. Both were sooooo good, but I was left wanting to try all the other sauces! I did also taste the macaroni and cheese which was the perfect marriage of cheese and pasta that melted in my mouth. (Double yum) The crispy Panko crust on the chicken was a nice touch to separate them from their competitors. The way I see it, BFG is the BFD and blow the other chicken strips out the water. Lastly I must add that the personalized customer service makes me feel special and I like that. It's clean, fast, affordable and downright tasty! You will see me at BFG's again very soon to start filling up my punch card for a free meal! Delicious guys!
As others have explained, their menu is very limited, offering only 3 types of chicken strips (baked, grilled or fried) and 3 types of sides (baked mac n cheese, grilled veggies or french fries)... and all combos come with Texas Toast.  Oh and I think they offer a salad too, but I didn't even look at that. haha

For our first BFG experience, there were 3 of us, so we thought we should try all 3 types of chicken fingers.  We ordered 3 combos -- the baked, the fried, and the grilled.  None of us wanted to be healthy and have the grilled veggies, so we subbed another order of mac n cheese on that one.

To our surprise (being the fried chicken strip lovers we are), we all decided the GRILLED strips were the best!  I think because we were comparing the fried ones to Raising Cane's.  Sorry, guys, but I do think Cane's has ya beat in that department.

BUT... Cane's doesn't offer delicious, creamy mac n cheese baked in a cute little individual-sized bowl.  And they don't offer.... drum roll.... NINE DIPPING SAUCES.  Mmm mmm... we got to try 6 of them and they all made our chicken finger experience EXTRA deelish.  I especially loved the wasabi cream sauce (thanks to all the Yelp recommendations for that)! They were all really good, though.  Can't wait to go back and try the rest.

As everyone has mentioned already, the owners are SUPER nice and make ya feel very welcome.  In fact... yes you can call me anti-social and I'll probably get blasted for this.... but I kinda thought Jin was a little TOO nice.  I love eating somewhere where the person behind the counter actually cares about pleasing the customer.  I really do.  But I also think there's a fine line between being friendly and being annoying.  Jin was teetering on that line throughout our lunch.

I do think it's impressive how he really makes a point to learn everyone's names, but I'd really be ok if he didn't keep saying my name (followed by a question) every 3 or 4 minutes while I'm trying to eat and socialize with my family.  Know what I mean?

We'll definitely be back, though. Good chicken, great prices, friendly people.  I wish them great success.
I have to eat lunch at least once a week.  My employees more like 4 or 5 times!

Lovin' the old #2 combo for $5.75.  And a frequent flyer card to go with it! Yay!

Keep up the good work boys!  Have a great 2011!
No, for reals! BFG, man! B... F'ing... G!

I've been itching to come here for the longest time, but since it isn't close to my house, my visit has been delayed, but since my gf and I were on vacation for winter break, we placed BFG on our Go-To list and we should've placed it on our Go-To list a few more times!  After reading the rest of my fellow Yelpers' reviews, I already decided on what to order before I even went there.  And when my gf and I showed up here and ordered without even having to look at the menu twice, Jin, the co-owner, knew we were Yelpers!  How cool!

I ordered the #2: Baked Chicken, Baked Mac and Cheese, and garlic toast with Sweet Chili and Cheese.  My gf ordered the #3: Fried Chicken, Baked Mac and Cheese, and garlic toast with Wasabi Cream and BFG sauce.  It was semi busy so Jin gave us a heads up that the food might take a minute and I thought that was cool that he was honest about it.  I saw the other owner, Tin, working up a sweat cooking in the back, but he was never too busy to give a welcoming smile and hello to everyone who came in.  I sat there and looked around and noticed how very welcoming and friendly Jin was with everyone who came in.  He called everyone by name and the best thing about it was that he remembered everyone!  He made sure everyone's drinks were full and had small talk with everyone like they were best friends!

When we got our food, we dug right in! Wasabi cream and Sweet Chili is THE BEST SAUCE EVER!  Definitely memorable and kills my other favorite Cane Sauce.  The chicken was perfectly cooked because even if it was baked, it wasn't dry, but full of juice and flavor!  The mac and cheese was a great addition to the baked chicken and complemented my palette! After we devoured our food, we had some small talk with Jin and got to know him a little bit more.  He even asked to take our photo when we finished our food!

The best part about our visit to BFG wasn't just the delicious chicken and friends, but the hospitality and winning attitude shared by Jin and Tin!  I wish you the best of luck and look forward to the future surprises that BFG has to offer!  The food was soo good, I had to order some to-go to bring home for my mom to try! BFG, son! And wha!?
Very delicious chicken strips here.  They have 3 main options, baked, fried, and grilled(obviously, hence the name).  I tried the fried as my buddy tried the baked.  Very juicy and tender, and most importantly not too oily.  They have a large variety of sauces from buffalo, ranch, teriyaki to custom made sauces wasabi cream, and BFG.  Very delicious for the price and if you're craving for some chicken fingers id definitely recommend this place.

Service was probably the key selling point here as the owner/manager Jin i believe, was really nice and outgoing.  Small businesses like these makes me want to provide them with much support.
BFG will make you go OMG, cuz it's the freakin BFD, when it comes to chicken strips!

{B}aked
{F}ried
{G}rilled

Such a simple concept, easy menu, hella cheap yet so BFD delicious!  The combos, not sure why they have numbers since it's pretty much 4-strips with your choice of cooking style, 2 sauces, a side, bread and a drink for $5.75 but I suppose every resto needs to have combo numbers!  I choose to "F" it, got it with Honey Mustard and Buffalo Sauce and Mac & Cheese as a side.

First off, I'd like to say that I was way impressed with their Mac & Cheese.  It's handcrafted, made fresh and baked to order, no Kraft Mac & Cheese here!  You can also order it on the side for like under $2.00 which is a steal!  It was so delicious and screamed comfort food.  Now for the chicken strips, they were seriously delicious!  Again, fresh and cooked to order but boy were they were crisp!  If I had to guess, they use a Panko type of batter?  Honey Mustard was good, the Buffalo is no joke but I tried a bit of the s/o's Wasabi.  Okay...I was apprehensive of the Wasabi as I'm not a Wasabi kind of guy but GET THE WASABI SAUCE!!!

Also, I've gotta say, the dude that took our order was really awesome.  Not sure if he was the owner or what but damn, talk about freakin superior customer service and total customer engagement!  He was able to remember everyone's names that were eating in the resto at that particular time and got into genuine social conversation with everyone.  How I know it was genuine?  He asked how did we hear about BFG, we told him a cousin from San Diego visted a few weeks ago and told us to check it out.  He was like, "Oh, was it Jeff?" DAMN!  Not only does he serve chicken strips but he does magic here too!  ;)

BFG is going to go F-A-R.  I'm sorry I didn't catch the dude's name but it's all good, we'll be back, for sure!!!
Loved the warm welcome from Jin. Loved that Food Network's Iron Chef was on one tv, football on the other. :-) Place was crowded at 5:30. Got the grilled chickie strips w/ wasabi n sweet chili sauces. Mac n' cheese is like the velveeta kind. Was comfort-foodin' it since it was 25 degrees outside and the mac-n-cheese was steaming hot.  

The great part about this resto, besides the above, is that you can dial in how healthy you want to eat. Go grilled chicken, steamed veg and/or salad and you're on track. Feelin' a little carbie/cheesy - mac/cheese and garlic bread. Want to get your fried grub on, there you go - fried strips. 

I like having options. Don't we all? 
Grilled with wasabi and chili sauce! Da bomb! I'll be seein' ya, Jin.
Awesome food. My girl friend and I had the baked special and the fried special great food, love the Asian influence on the fried Strips creamy wasabi well enough said, staff was great, friendly, and fast. All food was fresh and cooked right there. Overall great place to go.
Healthy or not? Hey this place has both, if your looking for your chicken to be fried or baked or grilled this is the spot to be. Not only great tasting chicken but the service is amazing. 

As my daughter and I both walked in we were greeted and he knew instantly that we have never been there so he explained the menu, which is pretty basic. I ordered the number 1 which was the baked chicken pieces) with mac n cheese and a drink. YUM! I ordered my daughter the kids menu which she picked grilled chicken (2 pieces) and french fries. As for the sauces there are a lot of choices I might say from your basic ranch to some Wasabi sauce, which I find interesting with chicken wings. I got ranch (yeah I know boring) and the BFG which is kind of like Raising Cane sauce. The Mac and Cheese was nice and cheesy and not that cheap microwavable mac and cheese.
Very good, I had the baked wings and MAc and cheese and I really liked it. The service was really good and friendly as well. I will return to try the other wings.
PUT SOME WASABI CREAM IN YO MOUTH!!

Came here with my yelp-izzles a couple weeks ago. LiLy D and I popped our BFG cherries. Elnino F was back for round 2. 

Owner Jin Choe asked us for our names and he remembered that we had actually met a week earlier when he was picking up food from Soyo where me and a group of the yelp-izzles were getting our drink on. I noticed that he was on a first name basis with all his customers. That's what's up!

What I ordered:

#1
-4 Baked Strips
-Baked Mac & Cheese
-Garlic Bread
-2 Sauces (I picked Wasabi Cream and Buffalo)
-Reg. Drink (Arnold Palmer)

Everything was yummy yummy in my tummy. The Wasabi Cream sauce was the bomb-diggity!! 

The service was excellent. Jin came around numerous times to make sure everything was alright and that our sodas were topped off. I will mos def come back to try other items from the menu and the whatever the weekly special is.

Thanks for dinner LiLy!
Finger lickin' chicken chicken - what combo you be pickin'?! 

Not Canes! 

Best " strip club" around!  Premium, juicy breast to give Spearmint Rhino some envy. Something wrong with you if you don't check out those breasts and not lick yo lips. 

I've been back with the BF for some BFG love and back with my Yelperazzi family. Something simple sometimes is the best food. Goooooo Tin! Please keep feeding us nomlicious strips (Gotta slap some Yelpers for not giving enough love to the guy in the kitchen). 

I tried something different with the Yelpizzles and got the bibimbap special ($5.25). It was pretty solid with a variety of fresh and crisp veggies and nicely marinated chicken with a perfectly fried egg. 

Apparently there are four weekly specials on rotation: bibimbap, teriyaki bowl, hot chick sandwich, and chicken nachos. I will update as I try the other 3 specials, salad, and baked chicken.

I already have a favorite down though- crispy strips, grilled veggies and wasabi cream and sweet chili. 

Thanks- Jin, Tin, Jin's sister (we didnt get your name) and the ladies cutting up the chicken in the back for your work and hospitality. 

We're hooked!
Great food, great ownership, great prices.  Support local small businesses!
Hit BFG Chicken Strips this weekend.  

This place is great !  Tried the baked strips, grilled veggies,  wasabi cream and BFG sauce  $5.75 and it includes a coke ( or was it $5.25 ?? ) either price is a steal for what you get.

GF got the grilled strips and those were equally tasty to the baked - will try the fried someday.  Just wish the place was closer to my pad .

BTW - service is top notch and it's great to see the owners making the effort !
You know what?  Options are nice, but man...get outta here w/that baked or grilled stuff.  Go Fried.  Forget the B and the G.  F it.  

Their chicken strips looked and tasted panko-encrusted (japanese bread crumbs)...and that- folks, is what sets them apart from the rest.  Sounds basic enough, but its genius in the most simplistic form.  The chicken is moist, the breading is crisp, the dips are fantasmo. (you get your choice of 2)  Their mac n cheese is a mentionable, especially if you like yours baked.  Be careful though, it's extremely hot when it comes out.

They also serve weekly specials, and my friend ordered the bibimbap.  A Korean dish made up of chicken, vegetables, rice, eggs, and a chili sauce.  Each ingredient in bibimbap is separated and pretty at first glance, but you'll have to mix it up and ruin the picture in order to eat it correctly.  Their bibimbap is pretty decent.  

The service?  Awesome.  Jin was taking orders at the cashier, and upon encounter, we were fast friends.  By the time he came around to each table to check on the customers (provided they weren't too busy) we were BFF's.  He'll make you feel special.  He'll give you stickers.  He'll dance for you.  (ok so he didn't dance but I bet he would if you asked).

So now when my friend asks me if I wanna go to "The Strip" I'll be thinkin BFG.  And Jin.  And Tin.  And Sister Tin.  And 2 other Sister Tin's who slave in the back preppin stuff.

"Tin is the cook who makes your stomach happy.  Jin is the one who gives your face wrinkles" - Jin
Hey YELP........can I get a 10 star rating please!?!?!?
My "check-in's" here don't accurately depict how often I enjoy this food.  My family is now down with the BFG, and my brother brings it home REGULARLY! 
New highlights:
~THE WEEKLY SPECIAL.........oh my!
This week it's chicken nachos and last week it was BiBimBap..........well done guys, WELL DONE!!!
=)
I can't get enough of this place!
Was just introduced to this place... and it is just down the road from my office.  DIGGIN IT!  The food and service were excellent.  I got there at a pretty lively time, place was almost full... still had staff coming over to check on my food and asking if I wanted a refill.

Try it... you'll like it!
Looooove it! would eat here more if it was appropriate to have chicken fingers everyday. Get the fried strips (my fav) with grilled veggies (if you are feeling healthyish) or the most awesome mac and cheese. Love the wasabi cream sauce. Family owned, small business. Good people, make you feel welcomed always. Check it out.
Here's a nice little local gem in the Las Vegas area that serves homestyle chicken strips. When you order, they include 2 different sauces with the meal. I had the ranch and the honey mustard but my friend ordered the wasabi cream. Man, was the wasabi cream the bomb-diggity.

I ordered the standard fried chicken strips with Mac-and-cheese and a small piece of garlic toast. I'm usually not big on mac-and-cheese but theirs was so so tasty. I know it's bad for you but it was oooh sooo good for the soul. The owner is very friendly and walks around and takes the time to make sure that everything meets with your approval and also satisfies the taste buds. They have different specials of the week and this week it happened to be the chicken nachos. Wish I could have sampled that but I will definitely do that on my next business trip to Las Vegas. 

All-in-all, you will not be disappointed when you come here. Great food, great value, and great service. Where can you go wrong?
Totally legit.  Panko crusted chicken strips perfectly cookied and seasoned.  Didn't get anything except the fried strips - not sure why'd you go baked or grilled. Eff that - go with the tastiest option.

Mac and cheese was decent as well.  Looking forward to trying their rice bowls, nachos, and korean dish who's spelling I don't want to butcher.  Owner is nice and friendly - though I personally didn't feel like talking that day so he probably thought I was rude.  

Check it out!  Delicious.
After all the recent raves, I have been dying to try BFG! My husband went and picked up 2 to go combination platters.
Mine had 4 of the fried strips, a side of the mac & cheese, a slice of garlic bread . I chose the Wasabi cream & thai chili sauce. My husband got the same except he got the fries.
Wow!  I like Canes strips but these taste so much better!  The panko breading is perfect. The strips were juicy and not one bit greasy!  The wasabi cream was as everyone described.  The thai chili sauce was good and would probably be perfect with the grilled or baked strips.

The mac & cheese was super delish-rich & creamy!  The fries were good as was the garlic bread.  In the future I think I would love to just order a platter of strips with a buffet of sauces!  

Definately a good value as well!  Thank goodness this place is less than 2 miles away!
I could devour a bucket of these! Throw in some mac & cheese & their garlic bread for instant food coma! Pick 2 of any of their sauces & enjoy that food coma with a big grin on your face.

Tender & juicy baked chicken, lightly seasoned, as the sauces steal your palate away for ride down ecstasy lane. Could use a little bit more browning but it still tastes great. 

Fun lil thing to do with your sauce selections. MIX them together! Sweet Chili & Wasabi Cream = explosive sweetness! Top it off with a generous portion of baked mac & cheese & garlic bread as sides, its OD heaven!

What makes this place push into the 5* category, is they take extra step to make sure the clientele is pleased with the food as well as feeling comfortable coming back for more. Prompt, very friendly & observant.

This is possibly the first place I've observed taking the extra step of individually wrapping each item on a togo order so it stays hot. And sure enough when I unpacked it after the 15min rush home it was still HOT! 

Locally owned, family run (from my impression), my new friday evening stop.
This place kicks ass!! 

Such a simple idea, but it's done sooo well. The strips are cooked to order and delicious. They have a ton of sauces, so no matter what you like to dip the strips in, you've got it! The owner is amazing, he makes a big effort to remember everyones name and is really attentive (walks around and does refills when the cash register slows down). My favorite is the weekly specials they offer, especially the chicken nachos...YUM!! Now I am a huge sucker for fake cheese nachos and these are fantastic fake cheese nachos! This has quickly become a favorite for lunch, quick, can be healthy if you can avoid the perfectly fried strips and heavenly baked mac n cheese, and super affordable.
These guys are friends of mine, but putting friendship aside.... I've tried a lot of chicken strips from canes to the bar to yard house... and these are the BEST fresh and crispy, the sauces are creative and innovative the only thing that I can say negative is that there not closer to my house... but trust me its worth the drive!!!! love it!! p.s. the hot chicks are my favorite..
wow this place was a disappointment...its rated so well...the baked chicken pieces were bland and the grilled veggies had a strange taste from the pannini press they were cooked on...the only good thing was the mac and cheese was okay...and the sweet chili sauce was the best thing that was served. the portion size is snack size also...dont know what all the yelp buzz about this place is...not for me. inka chicken grill is in the same shopping center go there instead.
Wow... Bretty F*ckin Good.. (Inside Joke) this place was awesome!! The price is great.. the service is great.. and the food was great.. what more can you ask for?!
I'm not so much of a fan of fried foods, but I must say that their fried chicken strips are SOOOOO GOOOOOD!!! 

I ordered the bibimbap and baked mac n cheese, and my friend ordered the fried chicken strips and baked mac n cheese.  I had to try her chicken strips because she kept saying 'MMmmmm!' after every bite! And man... 'MMmmmmm!' is RIGHT!! I tried it w/ the wasabi cream and with the BFG sauce.  The wasabi cream was better, in my opinion.  The bibimbap was really good, too but I think my next visits will be strictly for the chicken strips!  (Whenever I actually have a craving for something fried!)  And the baked mac n cheese is also real good.  I don't know what they use for their breading, but it is just so good I can't explain. LOL!
my coworkers and i order from here at least once a month! it's close to work and the food is pretty darn good... what's best is the PRICE!! you get chicken made your way (B,F or G), side of yummy mac & cheese and a sode for pennies!! well... not really pennies, but less the $10! :) they are always extremely friendly and give great customer service! check it out! you won't be disappointed!!
I know- how many flippin' review updates am I gonna do?!

But it's a BFG first (I think) to have a fan family.

It's already known the BF and I already love this place but we brought mom and grandma so their opinion matters.....the place is mom and grandma approved! My mom in law likes their mac n cheese a lot and for a person who doesn't like chicken, admits this is pretty good chicken. Grandma has been wanting chicken strips and she loved it. She's already talking about coming back. 

We also shared the chicken nachos so I'm 2 of 4 on the specials. Pretty good and a decent portion for $3.25. We all had a plate so we were sttuuuuffffeeeddd, but Jin totally pulled my leg to get it (thanks- I will get it again). 

The chicken strip phenomenon still perplexes me- so simple but it's crazy how much people it attracts. I love it so I am not complaining. Now I'm keeping an eye on Tin because there has to be some magical voodoo dust in the panko. I have not met a person with bad things to say about BFG yet I've met people who will talk shit even about Joel Robuchons food. One of my friends from Los Angeles knows about BFG and I wasn't the one who told them...seems like the chicken did more than cross the road. 

Vegas now and onto west coast domination?
Good food great price and customer service. A bigger dining room could serve them well.
After reading all the fantastic reviews on BFG, the husband and I decided to head over there for some winner, winner chicken dinner...err lunch.

The place is small, but luckily a table walked out just as we entered so we were able to grab a seat.  There are a total of like 6 combos that you can order, or you can order a la carte or a special.  The husband ordered the #1- four baked chicken strips, baked mac & cheese, two sauces (ranch & BBQ), garlic bread and a coke.  I had the special- Chicken Nachos.

I am on the once a week Taco Bell Nacho Bell Grande kick for the past month. (don't ask me why!  they just taste so good!) and these chicken nachos kicked its ass.  Chips, cheese, chicken, pico, sour cream, beans, scallions... delicious!

The husband liked his combo #1 and I also liked his mac & cheese.  Thank god he didn't eat it all and I get to have lunch off of it tomorrow! :)

I think it was the owner, Jin, who was very attentive and walked around to the tables to make sure that everyone was taken care of.  When we walked in, he asked "this is your first time, right?".  WOW!  He definitely knows his customers.

We will definitely be heading back to try more!
Honestly I would say  BFG is a  2.5  (I always round up.)

The location itself is very small. Upon walking in you can tell its a High Schooler hang out. Which is kind of a bummer seeing how there was a group of HS kids that took up half of the whole restaurant. 

The prices are very affordable. But the food I thought was lacking. Mind you I haven't tried the entire menu but over all I found it lacking. The fried strips are tempura style. They are light and crisp but in the end I have had many more flavorful tempura encounters. I will say that I enjoyed the grilled fingers but they weren't anything to write home about. With your fingers you get to choose 2 sauces. Based on other reviews I chose the wasabi cream and sweet chili. The wasabi cream had the taste of wasabi but no kick. The kick being the only reason I like wasabi made this sauce very disappointing. The sweet chili sauce was very flavorful and tasted great with the grilled strips and fries. Last but not least was the Mac and Cheese which was incredibly bland. As soon as I tasted it I knew what was missing; onion. But I guess I shouldn't expect such things from a restaurant such as this.  

The highlight of this establishment is the owner; Jin. He is very friendly and talks to all his customers and even remembers your name from previous visits. But after being here twice I don't think I will revisit. 

The bottom line is: They serve affordable food aimed towards teenagers and broke college students. Great service but mediocre food. Common sense states "You Get What You Pay For."

Happy Eating,
Jace
2nd time getting take-out from BFG.  On accident the hubby  ordered me the "baked" chicken...I thought it was blah & a tad too "wet".  Luckily the hubby traded me for the fried.  They were as delicious as I remembered.   The hubby said he would not order the baked again either.   

He also ate the side of fries and the grilled veggie sticks.  He thought the veggie sticks were "just right"-not too hard-not too soggy!  The fries were fine (I'm not a fan-mac & cheese next time for sure). 

Still loving the Wasabi cream sauce.  Hubby chose Honey Mustard -he gave it 2 wings up. 

We'll be back...
The owner was very welcoming and personable.  He called us by our names the whole time we were there and would ask if we wanted refills.  

We tried the #1 and the chicken nachos.  The nachos were very tasty and crunchy,  while the mac n cheese was creamy and some of the cheese on top was crunch (yummy!).  We preferred the breaded chicken strips over the baked.  You get to choose from a long list of dipping sauces.  I would definitely come back!
************SEX SUBSTITUTE************

There's plenty of reviews to tell you how great the food is. I am ashamed I have waited this long to hit this place up. 

I woke up this morning dreaming of the crisp, moist, juicy goodness. 

In addition to the sexcellent strips, we were treated to Jin educating 3-4 teens on the importance of going to college.  There were no eyes rolling.  These younstas took everything in with BFG glazed eyes. The teens, kids, Sr citizens love him. He is definitely the everyday people person who could relate to anyone.

BFG - not only can u get drug-like addictive food but you can also drop your kids off for youth counseling............................................... All this... One chicken strip at a time!!!!!
After seeing the rave reviews on Yelp, I decided to give BFG a try.

I ordered the #1 which consisted of 4 baked chicken strips, mac & cheese, garlic bread, and a drink. All for $5.75. You can't beat that!

The mac and cheese was served in its own aluminum serving bowl. It was piping hot. I loved the melty goodness. It was rich with melted cheese on top. Mmm, mmm good!

The garlic bread was delicious, garlicy goodness.

The chicken strips were smallish but good. They come with two sauces and I selected sweet chili and wasabi cream. The sweet chili had a nice balance of sweet and spicy. I really enjoyed the wasabi cream which had a little kick and was quite delicious.

I will definitely be back. I have already recommended BFG to a few people it was so good.
Went there with my family after reading all the reviews and the place is very clean (including bathrooms! - good job!), and the owner is about as nice as they come. We each tried something different, Baked, Fried, Grilled and I had the BiBimBap. Everything was excellent and cooked to order. The best was probably the fried strips, very light with perfect crunch. 

I took one star off (wish it could be 1/2 star) because portions could have been a tiny bit bigger. I will definitely go back again when in Vegas.
Super great prices, homemade quality and feel, very friendly staff.  These folks simply got it right.

Like the fried better than the baked chicken strips.  The mac and cheese is the bomb and so is the garlic bread.  Portion sizes are good too and my wallet always smiles when I go here.  That said, I could've eaten two of their meals at one sitting, but I simply didn't want to look like a pig.

Thumbs WAY UP for BFG!
The owner Jin is awesome! Great customer service.

This place is about 15 mins off the strip...worth the trip.

Ordered the weekly special at the time, which was Chicken Nachos without the refried beans and BF had the Fried Combo. Both were fantastic! The chicken strips were moist and not covered in flour like most chicken strips I have tried. And the fries were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and had a slight flavor to it. Got the ranch and honey mustard dips. The honey mustard dip was fantastic with the chicken as well as the fries. The Chicken Nachos should remain on the menu as they were just...that good! The chicken had seasoning and the pico de gallo went well with it...The only complaint I have is I wish there was more nacho cheese as I love nacho cheese.

Would definately come back when I am in Vegas!
Super clean, nice staff, free drink refills.
Kids loved the fried chicken strips - made w/ Panko breading so it's light on the fried taste.
I don't know, I really really wanted to love this place with all my heart.  I even rode my bike there one day to have lunch and I was mortified when they were closed on mondays so I ate at port a subs across the street in misery.  

Be warned I am going to make a comparison to canes, I fell like it's fair because they are obviously copying them a bit, which is okay with me.   

So I give strips themselves like 3 stars maybe 2, I just love canes so much and I always compare everything to them.  When you get down to the nitty gritty the food is better at canes, I like the batter better and the sauce is awesome.  BFGs panco breading just dosen't do it for me and the chicken isn't as tender, it does however come out fresh, crispy, and not greasy.  I think at BFG they cut strips out of breasts instead of using chicken tenders and this is probably part of the culprit. The garlic toast is small but tasty, canes delicious texas toast is better still as well as their fries.  

Now there is a lot of redeeming points this place has, so many I have to make a list;

*Healthy versions, but the baked kind of sucked, the grilled was decent

*Many many sauces, some better that others

*Pretty delicious mac and cheese

*Service, AMAZING, seriously when I left I felt like the owner was my BFF

*Dirt cheap

I struggled on whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars.  Here is the breakdown

Strips 2.5 stars

Other food 4 stars

Service 5.5 stars

Value 5 Stars

So that is an average of 4.25 stars so 4 it gets I guess, for some reason I still want to give them 3.
"#1 Restaurant Best of Yelp" Need I say more?.. I'm on my way!

Came here on a Sunday evening, they were half full but no wait. The Gentleman at the counter, Jin was Extremely Personable and guessed that I was a Yelper! Haha, nice. I found that he was the owner and his partner/owner, Tin was handling the backend/cooking. I did go with the Combo #1 with Grilled Chicken Tenders/Strips with the Wasabi Cream sauce and the suggested Sweet Chili sauce. It also came with Mac N Cheese, a slice of Garlic Bread and a Drink. All for under 6 bucks, Not bad.. Then, ordered their Special of the Day: "Hot Chick" - fried chicken tender, in a hotdog bun with their hot sauce and veggies.. Plus, I ordered a side of their baked chicken tenders and fried chicken tenders (just to have a taste of all the chicken variety they offered). And I also tried their buffalo and ranch sauces too.

My take on the items:

Baked Chicken Tenders: 3.5 Stars. Tasted healthy but didn't have much flavor.. The sauce took care of it though.

Grilled Chicken Tenders: 4/5 Stars. Mildly flavored, a bit sweet and tasty.

Fried Chicken Tenders: 5/5 Stars. The Breading (Panko?) was absolutely delicious with the chicken. Like a Tempura Chicken Tender!

Wasabi Cream Sauce: 3.5/5 Stars. Unique and mild wasabi flavor. Nice and creamy but didn't Wow me like I was expecting.

Sweet Chili Sauce: 4/5 Stars. Sweet, a tiny bit spicy , like a teriyaki type sauce. This was pretty good.

Buffalo and Ranch Sauces: 3/5 Stars. Both decent, as expected

Hot Chick (special): 3.5/5 Stars Think of Fried Chicken Tender hot dog with hot sauce and veggies. Not bad. But it did make me order more Fried Chicken Tenders!

Mac N Cheese: 4/5 Stars, Easy. Not the Best I've had but Way Better than KFC's! I think there were a couple different cheeses working together with that Nacho cheese oozing in the middle of it all! I'm a Fan!

Service was Superb, No Question! For a place like this, I never would of expected to feel like a V.I.P.! I think Jin asked me twice if I wanted a refill for my drink but Annie (the wife of Tin, the other owner) was quick to give me a refill before and after Jin already asked me.. Also, follow ups on the food and.. It goes on.. The Food and Value was better than Average. This Local Business Got My Support!!
I am not a chicken lover but I heard about this place so try this time.
I ordered combo meal #1 so I got chichen strips, garlic bread, mac& cheese and soft drink. I picked grilled chicken. It was moist enough not dried at all. I never like white chicken meat but this one is different.
Garlic bread was good and mac&cheese was baked well. I picked honey mustard and BBQ sauce. It was good, but I will try different sauce next time.
Also, staff was so friendly. 
Food is good service is good.
I'm definitely a fan...The quality of their grilled chicken is ridiculous. I've been to places where they grill the chicken and it ends up being too dry.  This place made it PERFECT!! the grilled chicken was still so juicy.  Great place, great group of staff, extremely good lunch experience :)
Ok, my review for BGF is looooong overdue (sorry Jin). Simply put, this place is AMAZING, puts a whole new element on how chicken tastes. The places before BFG were complete failures, so it's actually nice to see this place do so well.

The menu is extremely simple and effective, so it won't take you more than a few minutes to decide what you want.

Food is BOMB! And their weekly specials are also delicious. I'm particularly in love with the "Chicken Nachos", best nachos I have ever had. I usually get a number #2 and substitute the fries with the grilled veggies.

Service is some of the best from a place like this, thanks Jin & Tin! Prices are beyond reasonable. This place is just awesome!

BFG Chicken Strips is so awesome I vow never to give it up, never let it down, never turn around and desert it. Never going to say good bye and never going to tell a lie...
I really enjoy BFG every time I go there. The prices are very reasonable. I usually get the meal that includes 4 pieces of chicken, a side, a piece of garlic bread and a drink. I like the Fried and the Grilled chicken. I'm not a big fan of the Baked. As far as the sides, I really love the Mac N Cheese. It's awesome! It always comes out really hot and it's just melty cheesy goodness. The fries are very good as well. For the health conscious out there, grilled veggies are available. I really like the garlic bread and I usually order an extra piece. I still haven't found dipping sauces that I really like yet. But there are many options so I'm sure I'll find a few I like. Also, the Chicken Nachos are awesome!! They alternate between 4 different specials on a weekly basis. 

Jin is always there working when I go, He's friendly and professional. Plus he's a cool guy. So props to him. The place is also conveniently right near my house. I usually do take out but there is also a small dining area. Can't really go wrong here. You owe it to yourself to try it out!
So I've been looking for a hole in the wall or a spot to grab a quick bite near the CSN Charleston campus during my lunch breaks. Looks like I found it! Ordered some strips with the wasabi sauce. Bomb. Dig. Nice panko style breading, thin crunchy fries, nice customer service from the asian brother (owner?) and the options of sauce as well the preparation of your chicken: grilled, baked or my personal favorite fried.. Definitely the go to spot if I'm craving some cheap eats. 

I think its about time we get rid of these corporate chicken chains or other fried chicken spots with their food chillin up under those heat lamps all dang day. Don't you?
Have to agree with the positive reviews posted about BFG Chicken Strips.  They serve a simple menu, but the execution of their chicken strips is spot on. Weather you order it baked, grilled or fried, it will be served hot, cooked and still moist inside. And Jin is seriously a master at friendly and personable customer service.

It is not rocket science, but when restaurants can deliver the winning combination of serving good food + exceptional customer service, it pretty much means the customer will have an awesome experience.  And for someone that dines out daily it really is a refreshing change to dine somewhere that do all the important things right. 

I tried Combo #1 (maybe not the "healthy" combo, but it certainly does pack a lot of tasty flavor).  The fried chicken strips were very good (my second favorite).  I also ordered 2 strips each of the baked and grilled chicken strips, just so I  can do a little taste test and find out my preferences.  I really love the grilled chicken, it has nice flavor and was nice and juicy.  The baked chicken was good, but came in last for me when compared to its grilled and fried brethren.

About the restaurant, it is small but still perfect for accommodating patrons dropping by for a quick meal break from work or school or the modern day hunter gathers here to pick up a little something for the rest of the family units impatiently waiting at home.  It has WiFi, in case you want to surf the web/blog about your visit on your new iPad 2 while you get some nourishment.  It is located in a large strip mall, so parking should not be an issue.

Tinh and Jin's Mom + staff, runs the kitchen, while Jin mans the cash register and handles customer service, 12 hr/day, 6-days a week. Pretty tough schedule running a small restaurant, but they do a great job!

Food: 5/5 They have the techniques down when it comes to making chicken strips.
Service: 5/5  There are more than one way to provide awesome service, and BFG has certainly mastered it.  I think even more established restaurants or potential restaurateurs can learn a thing or two about what great customer service is here.
Location:  Close to the Rainbow exit on the 95.
Parking: 5/5  The parking lot is large, it should not be a problem.
Stopped by for lunch because of all the great reviews they get on yelp. It's a simple lil' restaurant with a simple menu. As soon as we walked in, they were very nice. I got the grilled combo and my friend got the fried combo. The wasabi cream sauce is really good as is the sweet chili sauce. I loved the mac and cheese. It's a great place to grab lunch or a snack and get away from the craziness of the strip. It's in a shopping plaza and has mostly regulars coming in to eat. So, it's nice to escape all the tourists. I liked how nice all the staff was. It really makes a difference when a restaurant is family-owned. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely coming back here!
BFG definitely knows their chicken!!!!

After months of eying this place, we finally made it for a spur of the moment lunch. We wanted to actually stop by on Sunday, but thanks to Yelp, it told us that they were closed. I made my fiancé meet me up at BFG's for lunch today. It was definitely worth the drive and being late for work.  I walked in and #1 combo caught my eye....the mac and cheese sold me. The fiancé ordered the #2 combo. 

Service was pretty awesome. One of the owners noticed that we were newbies to BFG's and took the time to explain to us what the different selections of chicken were. He also came back repeatedly to check on how we were doing. For a "fast" food joint, that's some pretty dang good service. 

For the food, I definitely did not go wrong with the #1. The baked chicken was so tender and juicy, it makes my mouth water thinking about it. It was seasoned with a rotisserie spice and baked. Also, the fact that it's juicy white meat wins them the 5 stars. I am not a dark meat fan and for those dark meat lovers, this white chicken will have you fooled. I liked that you could choose the different sauces although I ate most of my chicken without sauce. Mac and cheese was definitely cheesy. I'm a cheese whore, so this definitely met my standards. I was able to try the fried chicken and it was tender and juicy inside. I do think I prefer the baked chicken over the fried chicken though BUT that's just MY opinion. 

Overall, the chicken is very delicious and anyone who hasn't tried this place is missing out. We definitely will be back for more baked and fried goodness. OH and it helps that they have a stamp card.....benefits of going repeatedly...I'll take a free meal anytime.
This is must try...it was the best simple food and yet extraordinary service I had yet here in vegas. Gin was awesome the owner/Staff  had a great convo and introduction to his company...The food was simply made but pounded with mmm so ono kine flavor (mm so good flavor). I ordered the Mac & Cheese and it was good also the weekly specially Hot Chick awesome...the reviews are true Great job
If you haven't already visited BFG chicken strips, you really have no idea what you're missing.

The fried chicken strips with the baked mac & cheese are absolutely awesome. I highly recommend the wasabi cream sauce as well as the sweet chili sauce.

This place is a great example of having a great product with great service.  Over the past 5 days I've been here 3 times and both the food and the service are consistently awesome. I'm sure Jin knows how this combination of great food and great service contributes to his business.  Although Jin first told me to close my eyes and the chicken strips would taste like passionfruit, marshmallows and masago, I was pleasantly surprised how good it all was.  The fried chicken strips are crispy and juicy and cooked to order and the baked mac & cheese is really creamy and delicious.  

BFG Chicken Strips may be a little hard to find as there is no street signage but it definitely worth looking for!  It's just south of the Home Depot on Rainbow between Alta and Charleston.  Drop in and say "Hi!".
It's a rare occurrence that I even post a review at all, so take it for what it is: that it is damn amazing... and I haven't even touched any food yet.

Now why can it be amazing? The service was awesome. It may be just talking to the guy and giving him a form of payment, but man does he make a conversation out of it. He even remembers a lot of the people that have come and gone, asks them how the days been, explains the menu... hell, the man pretty much did everything but explain to me how taxes work. That's called service.

(EDIT: HIS NAME IS JIN. I feel bad that I forgot the first time around. Sorry dude!!)

Anyway, let's move on to the actual food... 

 Imagine a juicy chicken strip that's moist on the inside and yet somehow crunchy and flaky on the outside. It almost doesn't seem possible (the close comparison always is Cane's, but I'll explain why that's an impossible comparison), but that's exactly what BFG has done with their Fried Chicken. It's almost unthinkable as to what madness occurred for this to be possible, but it's been done. Not only is their Fried chicken that moist, but pretty much everything else is as well. The Baked chicken strips were peppered with some seasonings and baked to perfection, it comes out very moist and tasty. I'm not one for Baked Chicken Strips, but I'd try it every once in awhile if it had come down to it.

In addition to the chicken, their sides are very well done. Naturally, if you like/love/adore/lust after Mac and Cheese, then dear god go for the Mac and Cheese; it's baked goodness in a tinfoil pie thing. Their salad was enjoyable, but if you're going there to get fried chicken in a salad, you really need to get some priorities in order and really just stop kidding yourself. 

Naturally the big kicker is their array of sauces. I'm officially a big fan of their "BFG" sauce, simply because it's got a bit of everything in the flavor spectrum in "BBQ, spicy, and sweetness." None of that made sense, but that's the only way to describe it. Their Honey Mustard is something unique as well, so if y'all love it, go for it.

All in all, BFG is a chicken place that I might very well swap for Cane's from time to time, because (1) It's good food; it's good chicken... and (2) It's closer to me than Cane's. I mean, I'll still go to both equally (Cane's is open longer, so that's always a reason I won't abandon Cane's), but somehow BFG will make it into my routine.

... oh, and having a stamp card helps too. (b^^)b =7

SIDENOTE: So I was saying why you can't compare Cane's Fried Chicken with BFG Fried Chicken... I (personally, ie. MY OWN OPINION) believe that you can't compare two different styles of fried chicken strips. Cane's uses a batter of some sort, whereas BFG uses more Panko bread crumb-type food source. It's like comparing Apples and Oranges; useless. You just need to know that Cane's is good and BFG is good too. (b^^)b
Just finished dinner from here and it was really good. Hubby got a #2 - fried chicken, fries and garlic bread and I got the #1 - grilled chicken, baked mac & cheese and garlic bread. I really liked both types of chicken so much that I can't decide which I liked better. I did really like the fact that the baked was really moist and the seasoning added some nice flavor even before the dips. I really liked the crunchy coating on the fried, like another review said it was very much like panko breadcrumbs, which was a change from a breading texture like I'm used to, but a good change. 
The fries were good and not greasy but OMG that mac & cheese was AWESOME! The noodles were well cooked, not mushy, and the sauce was creamy and mild but that stringy crust of shredded cheese on top was heaven - I would go just for a serving of the mac & cheese.
We tried 5 sauces: BFG, buffalo, honey mustard, wasabi cream and ranch. I really liked both the honey mustard (not too sweet or too tangy) and the wasabi cream (could probably use a little more wasabi but still good and different). The garlic bread was good nothing amazing but in no way bad.
Overall I really enjoyed everything we ordered and will be adding BFG into my normal roster of take out dinners!
When you do something this good you don't need a giant menu! I always get the Freid Strip, my Girlfriend gets the Grilled, and my Daughter the Baked, all are good, so is the salad. Jin remembers EVERY name of EVERY person that comes in, it's worth it to go there just to watch!
 Clean, and yeah maybe no real ambiance, but really, you're eating fast food, and it's better than any other fast food places.

Edit: Jin is gone. :( The food menu has changed, and I am not as crazy about it, although they still have Wasabi Cream. It's worth a try if you're in the nieghborhood, but I don't know if I would drive for hours anymore.
A very good experience, we got there at a good time and didn't have to wait in line very long.  As a friend recommended we went with the fried chicken strips and stole one of our kids' baked mac & cheese.  The food was very good!  Fries...well I'm sure they were great right out of the fryer, I made the mistake of going to the comic book store next door to it and spending a little too much time there.  I never like cold fries but I can't honestly say how they were fresh, Sweet Chili sauce and ranch were my choices, the sweet chili sauce was very good, ranch was great as well.  Kids enjoyed their food and the wife was pleased as well.  Jin was great, he is running a great operation there.
Found a great sauce I love. The sweet chili is a great blend of sweet and spicy! Also, I enjoy the teriyaki and the cheese dip. But that sweet chili is bomb! 

I forgot to mention earlier that they have Gold Peak tea, which I love!! I prefer the sweet tea but the green tea that they offer is pretty great too!
Honestly, I wasn't expecting much. A fellow Yelper recommended this place and I thought, how good could a chicken strip joint be? Well gadzooks was this place off the heezy. 

The service here was as impressive as the food itself. We were greeted by a nice gentleman who asked if this was our first time in. We said yes and he immediately asked if it was from Yelp reviews (nice!). Obviously he follows whats going on in the Yelp community. He gave us some details on the many dipping sauces they have and checked on us twice throughout our meal. There are sit down restaurants that don't do this! 

I never knew that selecting dipping sauces for strips could be so stressful. With the combo meals you get to choose two sauces (which is more than enough). I went with BBQ & the BFG sauce, my wife with the Ranch & Wasabi sauce. They have several sauces to choose from, next time I'll definitely try something different (these were great, but variety is the spice of life).

Now the chicken strips deserve a paragraph dedicated all to themselves. We made the mistake of both getting the Fried Chicken Strips. Next time we will mix it up and each get a B-F or G (not the same). For a whopping $5.75, yes, fie dollar an sevety fie cent, you get 4 chicken strips, a side, a piece of garlic bread, and a frosty coca-cola beverage. For rizzle. It's a glorious deal. When it came to sides there was no other option as they offered homemade baked Mac N' Cheese. Schweeet! Topped with mozzarella cheese it was ooeeey and gooey, two things M&C should always be. Back to the strips though. Their not your atypical fried chicken strips. They use panko bread crumbs which is a HUGE bonus in my book. They weren't drenched in grease. In fact after eating them I didn't feel that heavy sadness that normal chicken strips cause. The chicken was so moist and juicy it was actually dripping. The bread crumbs weren't overwhelming, but just enough to get the perfect amount of crunch in every bite. I can only imagine how awesome the Baked & Grilled strips are. A definite must next time. Key words are next time. We will be back. This place is rad! 

Go out of your way to try BFG Chicken Strips, I don't think you will be disappointed.
I think I'm in love with a chicken strip.

Frank M. wanted me to try this place out, and I decided to give his taste the benefit of the doubt.  He came home with a few orders and sauces, and when I opened it I was happily surprised.  The chicken strips are panko breaded, large, and the sauces are great!  I love their wasabi cream sauce the most, to be honest.  What makes their strips fantastique are the sauces and that panko.  Damn good.

Seasoned well, crunchy, and hot out of the fryer, these strips will make you dream for more the next day.  That's exactly what happened to me!  try it out.  Oh, and check online for their specials.  They change daily.
This place is different, but good. 

They offer combos for their chicken fingers. You can get them baked, grilled or fried. And they have Baked Mac + Cheese, French Fries and/or Grilled Veggies to combo your chicken choice with. Plus you get a garlic bread piece. These combos come out to about $6.

I got baked with Mac & Cheese. 

They say you get four chicken strips with your order, but with the baked, it seemed like I got a few more...which was a good thing because they were small. 

Seems like a very healthy alternative, especially if you go with the baked or grilled, plus the veggies. Not very exciting, but healthy. Plus, they have a good selection of  sauces for your strips...I guess this is where you try and add some excitement to your food and give your taste buds something to celebrate.
They use panko for the breading, which is awesome! Their chicken strips are crunchy but still juicy inside. Very friendly people and yummy chicken :D

Check out their weekly deals!
Different but in a good way. A most try. I love it but maybe some may not.
All around good place Jin the gentleman working the register knew just about every persons name sweet chili sauce was our fav mix w/ wasabi cream also is good
Everyone else has nailed it so I"ll keep it short.
BFG Chicken Strips is excellent for these reasons:

Variety (baked, fried, or grilled chicken strips)
Sauces (many great dipping sauces to choose from)
Service (the nicest people you'll ever meet)
Value (high quality, freshly made chicken strips for a very fair price)

Don't miss out on the hype, since it's all true.  Get your Chicken on Son!!
Love this place.  Jin is amazing and always makes sure you're taken care of.  The food is great and a really good value.
Still very good, I had the Hot Chick and it was really good. This $2 special is fried strip in a bun with a special sauce that tastes very familiar to the Hooters wing sauce. I also had to have the unreal Mac and Cheese. The hot chick was good except the bun must of been a little old since they were really dry. I am still fan and will keep returning.
Let's get right down to business shall we?

As a local it's hard to find a place in town that you enjoy eating at more than once a week before you really start getting sick of it, but when it comes to BFG, I just can't resist.

This place takes chicken strips and offers it up in three different styles, and if you couldn't guess from their name the styles are.. Baked, Fried, or Grilled. Each style comes with sides that are served up in the same way, for instance getting baked chicken strips combo will grab you a baked macaroni and cheese on the side which, by the way, is a really delightful treat.

If you don't want to have a preset combo, you have the option of getting a combo which consists of any style strips and any side that you'd like and if you're not down with any of those options, you can always have a salad with your style chicken in it.

For families, there is a kids meal!

Any of the main combo options will come with two dipping sauces of your choice and there is a pretty good variety offered. My favorites are the Wasabi Cream and the Honey Mustard.

I think the best thing about BFG is that they offer weekly specials which, of course, change every week. These are the things that keep me coming back for more. All of the specials offered are just awesome. My absolute favorite is the Bi Bim Bap which is a korean dish that, if I'm not mistaken, literally translates out to mix it up. It is amazing to say the least.

One of the most notable things about this place is the staff. I only had to visit one time for our main order taker, Jin, to remember my name. Since my first visit he's addressed me and all my friends by name and not only that, he makes an effort to remember all of his customers by name and I gotta say, he remembers 95% of them from what I've seen. It makes the venue feel more down to earth and that's always a plus.

If you're from out of town, I doubt you'd make time in your trip to drive about 20 minutes away from the strip just to grab some chicken but I believe that if you can, the extra effort will definitely be worth it.
Jin you are the man! Rock solid, rock star stuff, food, service, everything. Never disappointed. Try the sauce mixing yet? I will have that wasabi mac & cheese next time I'm there! LOL
So I visited the BFG establishment about a month ago and I have been agonizing ever since on how to find the words to describe how awesome this place is.  Had never heard of the joint before but based on the outstanding reviews I thought it deserved a visit.  My husband and I took my two nieces (ages 5 & 6) as anytime you ask what they want for dinner their response is chicken and french fries.  So they are essentially experts in this field.  

Upon arrival we were greeted by Jin.  May I just say if everyone ran their restaurants with the friendliness and attentiveness as Jin the world would be a better place.  I thought to myself if the food is as great as the service this place is a godsend.  Finally, a nice easy menu - would you like baked, fried, or grilled?  Simple enough.  The meals come with (4) strips, a side, garlic bread, two dipping sauces, and a drink for the bargain basement cost under $6 dollars!  The kids menu comes with (2) strips, one side, small drink, and one dipping sauce.  

We ordered the fried chicken strips meals (2) adults and (2) kids meals with macaroni & cheese.  Niece #1 decided to go rouge and ordered the french fries with her meal but after being "forced" to try the mac & cheese it was all over as she began sampling the mac & cheese from all of our plates.  Niece # 2 asked "How did they get the macaronis to taste so good?"  This is a question I am sure the gang at BFGs gets a lot.  For first timers I would recommend each getting a different preparation of the chickens to share... we had a rookie mistake that won't happen again.  

I will keep it short and sweet.  This is the real deal Holyfield.  Visit BFG's.. tell them Dana sent you.   

To Jin - how about we expand and open up a second location on our side of town ... or perhaps a food truck?  =)
The Skinny: great fried and grilled chicken with awesome unique dipping sauces with some so-so sides(4) Service: even though it's counter service, you get the warm and fuzzies when the owner makes it a point to get to know you (5) Value: a great plate of food (plus fountain drink) for only $5.75 plus get your 10th combo plate for free? - bring it on!(5)

Planted in a rather large strip mall, this place is rather inconspicious. Situated next to the Home Depot, there were plenty of people even at 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon waiting for their plate of fried goodness.  And what a plate of battered deliciousness it is!

Combo meals ($5.75 each) are easy. Choose your style of chicken (baked, fried or grilled) and your side (grilled veggies, salad, mac 'n cheese, french fries). Each meal comes with two house-made dipping sauces, a drink and garlic bread. We ordered two combo meals - 1 plate of fried chicken with a side of mac 'n cheese, 1 plate of grilled chicken on a bed of salad  and tried 4 different sauces. We also returned for a second run to try their fries and 3 other sauces (neither my hubs or I like Ranch).

The grilled chicken was wonderfully succulent, and had a nice flavour and texture - very similar to Korean barbeque. Fried chicken had a perfect consistency - tender and juicy on the inside with a lovely golden crispy panko crust on the outside without being too greasy. It had a perfect ratio of coating to meat and completely satisfied our cravings.

The other attraction is the interesting combination of sauces they offered. We tried teriyaki, BFG sauce, buffalo, honey mustard, wasabi cream, sweet thai chili, and bbq sauces. Our favs: the honey mustard had a bit of a nice hint of heat to it( as mustard should) while the sweet thai chili offered a lovely combination of spice and sweetness. My hubby, who loves wasabi, adored the creamy concoction.

The reason for the 4 stars is probably the sides. While the salad was wonderful (the veggies were incredibly fresh) and the fries were great, the baked mac 'n cheese was only okay. The cheese sauce, perhaps little too generic tasting for us, but it's prepared well with ample amounts of cheese topping and perfectly cooked macaroni. Definitely comfort food. The garlic bread was flavourful but lack the density of a nice slice of bread.

These are really minor quibbles and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good eats at a fantastic price. The variety of the menu really makes this place a crowd pleaser especially with the healthier options. This place definitely gives other casual dining places (ahem! the Golden Arches) a run for its money.

Finally, the staff made a point to get to know you and make sure you have a good experience. They are more than helpful with making sure you have everything you need (utensils, drinks - you name it). This place has the makings of a great neighbourhood joint and I can't wait to come back here again!
This place is awesome for several reasons:

(1) Jin is super friendly and apparently remembers repeat customers!  That is pretty sweet.
(2) The homemade sauces are sooo good (love the buffalo)
(3) The chicken is tasty (even baked!)
(4) The grilled vegetables have a great flavor
(5) It's crazy cheap!

Two combos: Fried with fries and baked with veggies, comes with garlic bread and two drinks = under $13!  I had baked but I tried the fried and both were excellent!  It was obvious that a lot of the customers were regulars.  In fact, Jin asked me if it was my first time since he didn't recognize me.  That kind of service goes a long way, especially in this town.  Will definitely return to BFG, and not just to see if Jin recognizes me next time!  :)
This place has only been around like 6mo and I hope they stay. The menu is simple and everything I've had is great. My fav is grilled combo-grilled chicken with skewered veggies + every combo comes with 2 dipping sauces- my fav's are wasabi cream, sweet chili, and honey mustard. They run an "item of the week" and if you catch the chicken nachos= awesome. Family owned, Jin the front man remembers everybody!! Super props
As soon as I walked in these guys were on! The owner (Jin?) figured out ASAP it was my first time there; I guess cuz I actually looked at the menu! Anyways, I ordered and he shot the breeze with me since I came in some conspicuous clothing, he asked me what it was all about. It was super chill. I tried the honey mustard and sweet chili sauces. The sweet chili rocked my socks! The food is great; I only wish I hadn't decided to try this place while I'm coming off a particularly bad case of food poisoning. I can't eat as much as I would want. I kinda felt bad about not finishing my food; my Asian upbringing kept reminding me of all the starving kids in (insert parent's choice of guilt trip). The punch card is awesome, giving me eating goals is always a good idea. BFG, I will be back! (once my stomach can hold down food)
I LOVE Fried Chicken!  Fried Chicken is my last meal on earth and my deserted island food choice.  That being said, I am also a natural bone in person.  I like the occasional boneless piece of chicken and BFG is the best spot in Las Vegas to get Chicken strips and the only place I would go for them. Tastes better than "The Chicken Lady" in LA.
OMG, this place is amazing!

Baked,
Fried .
Grilled.
Those are your options for their delicious chicken. The menu is plain and simple. You have a baked options which comes with some of the most delectable mac and cheese you'll ever eat, ever, emphasis on the EVER! The grilled (for you health nuts) comes with grilled veggies. The fried comes with French fries. You can order any type of chicken and choose which side you'd like. I recommend the mac and cheese; believe me, you'll thank me later.

There are several types of dipping sauce. Their honey mustard is off the chain! It's sweet and savory all at once. The BFG original is tasty, too, it tastes very similar to Thousand Island,

My only beef with them is that their hours of operation aren't that great, but I am sure with time and demand they'll extend their hours. Definitely check this spot out for a quick, tasty bite if your in the Spring Valley neck of the woods.
One of my favorite spots!!!
While I've never encountered a combination of foods which included macaroni and cheese, baked chicken, and a slice of garlic bread...I am happy to report that I am not opposed to it.  I like having the option of choosing the method whereby my food is cooked.  I wish other establishments would offer the same.  I also like having pictures to accompany the menu so I know what I'm getting into.  The service was top notch; the owner recognized the fact that it was my first time at BFG. Customer service is incredibly important to me and the owner did a fine job of building rapport.  I am a fan of the BFG and sweet chili sauce which complemented the baked chicken well.  Mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy, a treat considering the boxed stuff I was raised on...I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.  Thanks to the owners for a great lunch experience.  Will be back again!
I think I'm in love. Seriously. Raising Cane WHO? The Grilled and Fried strips were my favorite. AMAZING! The baked Mac n Cheese was like Velveeta on crack. The garlic toast mmmmmm . Wish it wasn't so far from my house, but well worth the drive!
*Best Chicken Strips in Las Vegas*

Really enjoyed this place, easily some of the best chicken strips I've ever had. They have a simple menu but it is by no means limiting with the various options you can mix and match your meal with. BFG lets you know everything you need to know about the chicken choices Baked, Fried, or Grilled. Once you chose the chicken you have the tough decision of which of the 9 dipping flavors to choose from; Wasabi Cream, BBQ, Ranch, Buffalo, Honey Mustard, Sweet Chili, Teriyaki, Cheese, and BFG (their house dipping sauce). And finally accompanying each meal is a piece of toast and your final decision between a side of Mac n cheese, grilled vegetables, or fries.

Now let me start off by saying that all the different types of chicken are delicious. I was a bit skeptical about the baked chicken but let me tell you, they know how to do it right. Whenever I picture baked chicken, it seems bland but at BFG they spice it just right to give it a kick in flavor. The grilled chicken has a bit of sauce giving it a unique flavor setting it aside from the baked. And finally the fried chicken is amazing! These aren't your run of the mill chicken strips you get at a bar. You'll notice the difference immediately due to their use Panko instead of regular batter which I love because it gives the chicken a nice crispy texture with just the right amount of breading. 

Now the sauces are really up to personal preference. and the majority are pretty run of the mill so I'll just get into their "unique" sauces. The BFG house sauce has a very light undertone flavor resembling thousand island and other flavors that will need more tastings to get down. The sweet chili sauce is an asian style sauce with the spices in it working very well with the sweet flavor of it. I was very surprised by how well the sweet chili worked with the chicken. When I first saw and smelled the Sweet chili sauce it seemed like it did not belong next to chicken strips, but when you take your first bite of a chicken strip covered in this sauce it will all make sense. It's a delicious flavor explosion in your mouth with the sweet chili enhancing the flavor of the chicken. Easily on of my favorites. Now the wasabi cream is pretty straight forward, it tastes like wasabi. But it is not nearly as overwhelming as actual wasabi and it has none of the burn. It is another surprising flavor that I have not seen anywhere else and that taste delicious.

I haven't gotten a chance to try the grilled vegetables but to me the mac n cheese and fries were not really anything special. And the toast tastes like toast. Also every week they have a new special which I have yet to try any of so when I get a chance I'll update my review.

Overall good service, good food, and decently priced. There really isn't much else to say other than if you haven't tried BFG yet, try it!
This place has the best chicken stops.  The crunch on the fried strips makes them that much better.  We had the wasabi sauce.. My fav..  Buffalo.  Very good..  And the sweet and spicy.. Also very good.  The wasabi has a mild heat.  Nothing to be afraid of because it also has some sweet to it..  The Mac and Cheese ROCKS!!!!
Based on all the 5 star reviews I was expecting magic chicken strips breaded with crack. But, no... just regular chicken strips. I'll admit they're good... we got two orders of the baked strips (one w/ fries, one w/ grilled vegies) and one kid's order of the fried strips. All were tender and juicy... I liked the flavor from the marinade on the baked strips... really good fries... great service, Jin checked in on us a few times making sure we enjoyed everything. This place is a much better option than going to Raising Cane's, esp. w/ the baked strips option. I just don't know if I'd drive across town to come here. Still good food, though. 3.5 Stars.
Excellent. Got fried chicken with fries and garlic bread. Fries were perfect. Chicken was moist, not greasy at all, and the panko very tasty. Got sweet chili and BFG sauce. Sweet chili was so good, haven't made it to the BFG. Very cheap, not even $7 with tax. For what it is, this place has it figured out. Really friendly customer service. I will definitely be back and bringing friends this time.
I heard of this restaurant from yelp, and I was in the area finally, so I couldn't pass it up. It was an extremely small place, and I only worried about finding a seat once I got my food. The tables were all filled up. The cashier, very attractive cashier Jin asks for your name to call you when the food is done. 

The food didn't take long, and a table came open just in time. Perfect timing! 

The handsome cashier walked around the tables asking if everyone was ok and enjoying themselves, and also cleaning up. As he walked by me, he asks me by name if everything is ok. He remembered my name from the order. He said "You forgot an important part of the meal" and brought me napkins I had forgotten. Now talk about customer service!  I was already wanting to visit this place again just by that humble moment lol. 

The food was hot and delicious. It seemed like such a small portion, but once you started eating it filled you quickly. It began getting busy and I can see why. This food was excellent and affordable. It was such a simple place, and seemed to be doing just fine with business. I hope to see more of them all over Vegas one day. 

I am a fan and will return.
SUPER tasty
SUPER friendly

baked strips and mac and cheese are killer...
Tried this place for the 1st time today and I have to give it 5 stars. Jin helped me at the counter and was helpful in suggesting sauces for my #3 combo ( grilled chicken & grilled veggies). For the amount and quality of the food I got, I am certainly impressed and satisfied. 
 Their grilled chicken was flavorful and the chili and wasabi sauce I chose went awesome with it. I got an additional side of the mac and cheese, which was a big mass of cheesy goodness. Oh man, I can't wait to come back and try their other types of chicken strips and sauces.
 So I definitely suggest anyone who's hungry and on a budget to give this place a shot, because it might just become your new best friend. I think it might have just become one of mine! Woo HOO! Thanks BFG for being nice to my wallet and my stomach. *high five*
Good food.  Good service. Good prices.  

The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The Mac and cheese was perfect. The garlic bread was soft and flavorful.  The service was super friendly.

I usually would stay on the strip when visiting Vegas, but I would go off the strip for this place.
Super yummy! Panko makes a big difference. And the huge variety of sauces give it a personalizable gourmet feel. They need to expand, because good luck getting a place to sit. Plan to take-out.
There really isn't much else to say about BFG that hasn't been said many, many times prior.

The food is as delicious as it is simple.  The service is incredible and when I had to move back across the country I felt bad that I would no longer be able to give Jin my money anymore for his delicious chicken strips.

The chicken strips are great whether you get them Baked, Fried or Grilled.  I was always partial to the Fried due to the breading being so crisp.  The Mac and Cheese is wonderfully cheesy and stays hot and gooey for a very, very long time.  They offer a wide variety of dipping sauces and you really can't go wrong with them.  Pick as your mood/taste dictates.

The weekly rotating specials are also all very good choices to get.  I am partial to the nachos but the Bi Bam Bap is also fantastic.

There's a reason why BFG has consistently ranked in the top few spots for food in Vegas.  What it does it does extremely well for the food and Jin goes to great lengths that are no longer common at all to make you feel welcome and valued as a customer.  Its really strange to see how customer service has more or less died but it makes it easy for a well-run place like BFG to endear itself to so many Vegas dwellers.  I look forward to the next time I am in Vegas so I can get some fried strips, mac and cheese and hopefully, it'll be chicken nachos week.

Before we moved I was unable to eat here one last time due to surgery and had to watch my wife enjoy one more Bi Bam Bap from there while I drank an Ensure.  A tough thing to endure.  Actually, as I submit this review I see its chicken nachos week and it pains me to know I can't get any, well, barring a 2100 mile flight/drive...
The food here was AWESOME!! The service was extraordinary! Everyone knew my name from the moment I placed my order and they checked on our a table a few times. The chicken was juicy and moist, they have about 8 or 10 dipping sauces to choose from. My friend had the mac and cheese and loved it!

This place is a definite must if you're visiting Vegas!
I have been to BFG several times now after finding it on Yelp....and overdue on my review.  We have tried the baked, grilled and fried chicken strips.....all of the styles were very good and everything is cooked to order.  I love the sides....but the marinated vegetables are really awesome.  There are about 8 - 10 dipping sauces to choose from and although I love all of the ones that I have tried....the wasabi cream sauce is my favorite!!! I drive from Henderson and it is well worth the drive.....although I would love if they would open more locations around the valley.....maybe Henderson will be next?  ;-)  
This place is a great example of having a great product with great service!!!!
Awesome.

Highly affordable awesome value and taste!

This place was one of the biggest surprises on our recent Vegas trip.  We had seen the high ratings on Yelp prior to our visit so the wife and I had to make a stop and I'm glad to report that we can't help but concur with all the positive praise for this place.

Chicken strips...what more can I say.  You can get them Baked, Fried, or Grilled.  We both decided to build our own combos and seeing as how we were on vacation and not worried about being healthy, we opted for the fried strips with baked mac & cheese and garlic bread.

The strips were crispy but not heavy like something you'd get from Popeye's or KFC.  The breading is definitely more panko crisp than buttermilk batter crunchy.  Delicious and moist.

The baked mac & cheese was awesome as well.  Very hot when it shows up at your table but once you're able to dig in, cheesey explosion and tender macaroni are headed your way.  I like how the macaroni noodles themselves were tender without being mushy like KFC's.  The garlic bread was a nice finishing touch and not something you'd typically expect from a more fast food-esque establishment.

You get your choice of 2 dipping sauces and we chose BBQ, Sweet Chili, Buffalo, and Wasabi Cream.  Two words: WASABI CREAM.  Perfect.  You get a slightly spicy wasabi flavor without being over-powering and the creamy texture helps smooth it out.

The food was so good that we stuck around and added an order of fries which were perfect as well.  Golden, crispy, and lightly battered.

The service was awesome and the staff super friendly.  The guy who took our order was very nice and engaging and was making sure to check up on us as well as the other patrons which is refreshing to see in a small establishment.

I'm happy to say that we will definitely be making this a regular stop.  At about $12 to feed 2 people with awesome food, how could we not?!
Dood...

The bestest chicken strips in Vegas, forget about the rest! The buck stops here, o sooooo tender n juicy inside, crispity, scrunchity outside with the Panko flakes.
The fries are goo too! Mac n cheese a bit too cheesy for me but if you like cheese u will luv it! 

3 ways to get em folks.....

B aked
F ried
G rilled

Grilled veggies are delicious, yummmm

They have weekly specials also:
Watch for the hot chick $2 not gonna find that deal at the local stripclub....

 Chicken nachos? U guys r killin me....

Why do you do it, BFG?!?
The food is four stars because but WOW! The customer service is superb which bumps it up to 5 stars!
Great service!  Good food!  And did I mention GREAT service?  The owner knows almost all of his regulars by name and order.  I have no idea how it does it, but it's really cool.  All of the staff are incredibly friendly.  The food is great too.  Try all three varieties of their strips... they are all good in different ways.  Some of their sauces are better than others, so just try them out to see which one works for you.  And get the mac and cheese!  It is sooooo good!!
c'mon guys.....

Bibimbap?

Really?

Just when I thought i've seen it all.....you guys throw out Bibimbap as the weekly special?

I gotta say you have to be very creative to pull this off and to offer this in a chicken strip joint.... I can't believe it, even my co-worker who never had Bibimbap or Korean food to say the least tried and LOVED it, although he couldn't remeber the name of the dish (weak sauce) he showed me a pic and I was like dat looks Korean to me!

I must say I'm impressed!  GOOD JOB BFG!!!!!!  Can't wait to see what's next.....

as for the rest of the menu.... excellent!  even the grilled veggies are the BOMB!  I've had the Fried and Grilled chix so far.....up next is the baked.

as in the Highlander..... "there can BE only one"

and BFG is it.....  just eat it.......!!!!!!!!!!!!

C
Best chicken strips in Las Vegas!!!!! The wasabi cream and sweet chili sauce is where it is at. The service is great, they just need to open a location in Henderson so I can eat there everyday.
Perfect recipe for success:  #1. Great-tasting, freshly cooked food to order, #2. Recession-level pricing, #3. Commitment to customer service going so far as to try to get to know every customer on a first name basis, even first-timers.

I hope BFG is here to stay and based on the foot traffic when I ate there, my guess is that they will be.

Jin warned me about the temperature of the mac & cheese.  These little subtleties make such a huge positive difference in the overall experience.
Who ever trained these people customer service skills, need to teach the rest of this city!! I was so amazed how friendly the staff is at this joint. Even if the food sucked, (which is doesn't) I would come back just to be treated the way they treat their customers. 

I love the concept of the Baked Fried or Grilled. I got the Baked and Fried and I definitely will be back to try the grilled. The mac & cheese is by far the best I have had in a looong time.  Great place for something quick to eat.

They make it a point to say goodbye to you by NAME, when you are leaving. I will be back!!
I love this little "mom and pop" chicken joint! The owner is super nice and friendly with all the customers, the setting is reasonable considering its size, and the FOOD FANTASTIC!... I'm going to make this short and sweet (like me ;b) :

Chicken: Baked, Grilled, FRIED (being the best, PANKO, similar to Hawiian style breaded chicken, friggin DELICIOUS)

Flavors: WASABI, BBQ, Buffalo, Honey Mustard, Sweet Chilie, Teriyaki, Ranch, and HOUSE STYLE SAUCE (YUM)

Signature: Hot Chick (like a hot dog and chicken sandwich put together, try it! on $2) 


Price is not bad at all for what you get and of course they have other items like salad and oddly enough their own unique style of MAC n CHEESE, which was also very good :D
Another great meal thanks to Yelp reviewers, without whom we never would have found this cool little shop. We had lightly-seasoned baked and panko-crusted fried strips with a variety of sauces, fries, and macaroni and cheese. So delicious we all wished to have a branch locate near us in our distant cities. Kudos to the friendly staff and their great cooking.
It is what it is. Needs some fine tuning but it's nothing special one way or the other. It is better than McD's.
Just got back to San Diego from Las Vegas and had to yelp it.  Their fried chicken is so light with what must be a panko crust cooked to perfection.  The wasabi cream sauce was the best with the sweet chili coming a tight second.  Mac and cheese very decadent.  I had the fried chicken with salad and came back a couple days later for the weekly special of a teriyaki bowl.  The family loved their picks too!  Very friendly service and the price was right.  The Thai iced coffee kicked butt!  The only bummer is the styrofoam containers-were they biodegradable?  If not, go to reusable or recycled paper or plastic.  These guys know customer service as they stayed open for us when we got there at closing a 8pm.  If you have a car in Vegas, check them out- easy to get to.
the main guy who works there is super friendly and helpful!

Pretty simple menu. Do you want baked, fried or grilled chicken strips?

If you are a fan of Mac N Cheese.. you need to order their mac n cheese!!

Cheap eats
Good food, convenient location and friendly staff.  Sounds like the perfect little chicken joint!  The menu options were great...I got the grilled chicken with mac 'n cheese, and he got the baked chicken strips with fries.  I have to admit the baked version were a lot better, so I would go with those next time.  I really liked the ambiance here, plus the food was great for a weekend lunch stop!  We will definitely be back to try the other options!
Pretty tasty .. Super friendly staff... And very affordable .. Will be coming plenty of times.
3.5 stars.

I have had BFG on my list of "must try" for awhile and we finally ventured in last week.  We ordered take-out and ordered the BFG trifecta. 1 Baked meal, 1 Fried meal, and 1 Grilled meal, and selected 6 different sauces to accompany them.  

We live less than 10 minutes away and the meal was still fresh and piping hot by the time we laid it out on our dining table.  Everything tasted pretty good, but didn't wow my taste buds like I had expected.  My husband preferred the fried chicken and baked mac n cheese, while I preferred the the grilled chicken and grilled veggies.  The extra .5 is because the service was awesome, and it truly is an amazing value- and because of that, I will be back.  Besides, I still need to try their specials!
Toss those chicky nugs from McD's into the bin, because there's a far, far superior place to get your hot chicken infusion on.  I really like their combination of great prices, delicious baked mac 'n cheese, and amiable staff!  Plug it in next to a gaming shop and it's like my secret nerd heaven.

I recommend going with the fried chicken with baked mac, especially if you need a last meal before death (it is pretty rich, it might serve as executioner!)  Baked strips didn't really seem large and in charge, mostly noodly. 

Also, never say "chicky nugs."  People will laugh at you.
I went a bit out of my way to try this place out, and a definitely was not disappointed! Awesome, solid service deserves 5 stars and the good food deserves 4.5. Picked a build-your-own combo, loved their mac, and the fried chicken was yummers! I also tried their special of that week (bibimbop... Sorry about the butchered spelling), and it made me wish I had a bigger stomach.
Fabulous service. Chicken was great...as were the fries. We're from Phoenix...so this is  a definite stop next time we're in town.
Got my usual fried chicken fingers with mac and cheese, garlic bread and double dose of their wasabi dipping sauce...as always, ONOLICIOUS!!! ALOHA!!!

YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(34/365) "Winner, Winner, Chicken Finger!"
This place is great.  The best thing on the menu is the mac and cheese.  It's baked and rich and aboot the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten.  All three chicken styles are great my personal choice is baked, with wasabi cream dipping sauce and sweet chili sauce.  The staff is wonderful, Jin who is always there at the counter is always friendly.  This is great comfort food with a reasonable price, and a kind staff. Eat here, or else.
BFG or Baked Fried Grilled delivers on every level.  Admittedly, I have a bit of  problem when it comes to any place to eat.  I always feel the need to compare anytime I eat at multiple places that offer the same types of food.  Prior to coming into BFG, I frequented Raising Cane's quite a bit.  At the time, I believed Cane's to have the best chicken fingers around.  In my opinion, they still do.  However, BFG has more variety and variety is the spice of life.  Here's what I mean:

BFG offers a wide array of sauces, six to be exact.  I don't remember the names of all of the sauces that are offered, but I know that I was pleased with the Wasabi Cream and the Sweet Chili.  Cane's offers one type of sauce and not much else.  I ordered the Number 2, which included four fried strips, fries (crispy and delicious) and a side of garlic bread, all for around $6.00.  I was also able to sample a baked strip, which was good and a side of their mac and cheese which was creamy and very filling all on its own.   The Chicken Nachos were also good (my friend ordered these, I swear I'm not a total fat-ass).  

I am most impressed with their options.  They also offer baked or grilled strips and replace french fries for vegetables, a very good choice for those on a diet.
Okay, enough already!  The Husband has been loving this place since I brought him here (thanks Yelp!) and he can't get enough!

BFG...it stands for Baked, Fried, or Grilled if you missed that part.  

The menu can't be any simpler - it puts In N Out's menu to shame.

With five combos to choose from and a create your own combo, it makes ordering super easy. 

Their fried chicken strips come in a four count and they are special because they are panko covered and deep fried.  Yes, that makes all the difference.  But wait, there's more beyond the chicken!  I'm talking about the wasabi cream dipping sauce that we can't get enough of.  Sure, there are other flavors and you get two with your order, but we're all about the wasabi cream!  Yum!  I've also tried their grilled chicken and was impressed with how moist it was.  Next time I'll have to check out their baked version.

Of course, I have to mention their individually baked mac and cheese side, right?  They are so gooey and hot, and that's what you call a serious baked mac and cheese.  They definitely got that right!  A little more work on their end but definitely appreciated and worth it!  Or if you must, you can have grilled veggies or fries as a side.

And there's still more to rave about - the garlic bread is good too!

Another perk - loyalty stamp cards!  Yes, that's right!  You get a stamp for every combo meal you order, so it's easy breezy to get a free combo meal with this plan!  

And finally, I cannot say enough about the customer service there.  Jin is the nicest guy around - not only does he make a honest and sincere effort to know who you are (and remember your name), but he also comes around to check on you if you're dining in.  They really make you feel at home and special and I have to give major props to that alone because it really makes a huge difference.

I also have to give props to the rest of the staff because you don't have a lazy bunch working here.  They are always coming around to wipe down the tables, push in chairs, offer free dessert, and just make sure you're happy.  

Their only real fault is that their location is too small!  But that only means they should open a few more locations to make our lives easier!  Yes, that's right.  Check out their weekly specials too!  They have a great thing going on here!
Wow, a huge number of reviews about this place, and yet I only heard about it this past week.

Went in with the hubby on Thursday night. Decided to try it on a whim. I had the #1 special and he had the #2. Everything was fantastic for the most part, so I spoke with the owner a bit, took a few menus and away I went. 

The next night I came in with 2 more people and ordered again. That's some damned good mac and cheese! 

The only thing I can't figure out is why people are raving about the wasabi cream dipping sauce. It was ok, but not really that good. The sweet chili is MUCH better.

I hope these guys stay in business for a long time, and don't raise their prices too much. It does need to go up a little bit, but stay low enough to keep it being worth me driving 15 miles for!
Thank you Yelp for broadening lunch place list.  This place is delicious.  

In general, baked chicken worries me because I never know if I'm going to get a a dry piece of chicken.  However, the baked chicken strips here were moist and well seasoned.  They were so good that I almost ate all my strips without the sauce.  And then I threw in some wasabi cream sauce  that everyone keeps talking about.  It starts off so sweet... and ends with a kick to the nose!  Wow, what a great combination.  I think I'm in love.

And finally... the mac n cheese.  I've never had anything so cheesy, gooey, and oh so delicious.  

You can't beat the good and the price of this place.  I will definately be coming back for more.
Super friendly staff here as well as pretty damn good chicken fingers as we call them in the South.  I only tried the fried ones with the wasabi cream sauce which was pretty darn good too.  Support this local business instead of crappy chains! :)
the fried chicken strips are excellent.  also enjoyed their weekly special...at the time they had bim bim bap.  great homey service.  check it out.
Another great recommendation from fellow yelpers. Just an FYI this place was a little difficult to find in the shopping center since they are sort of at a weird angle. Came here during the lunch hour rush and yes it was pretty packed. I even had a hard time trying to find a seat. I ordered the number 2 with BFG and wasabi sauces. The chicken was really moist especially considering the fact it was baked. Also, nicely seasoned. The mac n cheese was absolutely amazing.  Gooey texture, while not being too overwhelmingly cheesey. Although I would of liked it more of there was some crunchy texture on top like crumbled crackers or something?  It actually came out piping hot, which I loved. The sauces were great as well especially since I'm a sauce kinda guy. BFG definitely beats Canes. I can't wait to come back and try the fried chicken strips. Bravo BFG Chicken Strips, you shall be seeing more of me!
One of the best places I've tried for chicken strips! Great customer service, prices are unbelievable. 5.99 for strips, two sides and drink! Variety of sauces to choose from. Would probably stick with fried strips,, best choice of the 3 styles, gotta live a little right?  :)
i would go much more if they were closer to me or if they delivered, do they deliver? lol
the chicken tenders were very good, a little on the light side of seasoning for me, but i appreciate that its veryyyyy obvious that the chicken is fresh and well prepared. 
the garlic bread was also very good, crunchy perfect amount of garlic/butter.
the sauces were also very good, and made up for the light seasoning on the chicken.
also, what was really impressive is that the sauces are homemade :)

the only thing i didnt like (which they said isnt homemade) is the fries. maybe im just spoiled by homemade french fries :) but they were only passable at best. 

overall though your going for the chicken, not the fries :) impressive little place!
BFG...now THEY do chicken right.  Whether your appetite is calling for baked, fried or grilled chicken, Jin will do you right.  The menu is kept simple and sticks to what they do best.  There are several combos to choose from, but I think many will customize their own meal: choose your chicken, your side and two sauces.  Easy peasy mac'n'cheesy!

I'm a big fan of the grilled chicken.  The baked is easily some of the best baked chicken I've had and the fried is the most unique fried chicken I've had (thanks to the panko flakes used for breading).  But the grilled chicken gets you the grill flavor without drying up the poultry.  Go for the wasabi sauce to give your chicken some kick.

With your chicken you're given a choice of side, and you also get a slice of bread.  The mac'n'cheese is awfully cheesy in the best way possible, making it one of those foods you enjoy eating because you know you shouldn't be eating too much of it.

Service here is great, with Jin checking on all of his customers during their stay.  He's a really personable guy, seemingly remembering every customers name once they step through the door.  (He remembered my name after one visit!)  The one thing that bummed me out in the past was that my BFG cravings always came on a Sunday, the one day they're closed!  Fortunately, Jin has sensed this disturbance in the force and will be fixing that in the near future...
My husband and I were on our way to dine in at the Pizza Hut on charleston and antelope last night, and discovered that it was permanently closed :(   we had to find an alternative route fast, as our one year old was hungry and getting cranky.

My husband found this place on his phone and the ratings were really good, so we decided that trying something new is always good.

wow...the food was amazing!    The chicken was cooked perfectly, it was not heavy or greasy and it felt like the perfect amount of food.

we ordered the grilled chicken meal with the mac and Cheese and an order of the baked chicken with fries, and just decided to mix and match pieces from each plate. the Mac and cheese was to die for and the sauces were really good as well.

We shared a bit  of everything with our one year old. He scarfed everything down...he loved it :)

Not to forget .....on top of the great food, the service was amazing as well. Jin checked on us twice, and even sat down to talk with us for a little bit.  He is the nicest guy and you can tell that he cares how the customers are doing and if they enjoyed their meal. 

In small restaurants in this town, great service is very hard to find. 

We were very happy with our choice, and will go back there again in a heart beat.

BFG... Keep up the good work!
VERY good, Customer service is second to none as well. Highly recommended!
This place is awesome! 
My boyfriend Charles and I just drove 4.5 hours from California and it was 7:40pm and we were out-of-it and starving. We were going to take our food to-go as BFG closes at 8pm, but the owner Jin was soo nice and understanding, he still let us eat-in. I mean the hospitality was AMAZING...and so was the food! Chicken strips can be easy to dry out, if not done right, but man...whether it was fried or baked these strips were always moist and seasoned just right. My boyfriend loved the fried because he loves panko breaded chicken :)  The mac n cheese....ohhh gooey cheesy goodness. Actually baked in the oven.

well, long story short, we were in town for less than 48 hours and we managed to come back and eat here twice! Thats how good it was. It was the best $6 meal I'd had for as far back as I can remember...

The simplicity of the meals is what makes this place best...The chicken is really the star here. Plus, the portions are perfect.  Fantastic food at a fantastic price...oh it was AWESOME.

Thanks Jin! Next time were in town, we'll be back  :D
The food is absolutely amazing, from the chicken tenders to ALL the sides!  I've had the garlic toast and mac and cheese, and they were both very yummmy!  The service is the best, especially since it seems like the owner knows all of his guests, even if you don't frequent often.  I would definitely come here more often if they weren't so far away.  They have these weekly specials that they update on facebook that always looks very delicious.
A perfect place to get good food awesome customer service at a cheap cheap price. This is my new favorite lunch spot.
The food was basic, good, and fresh. However: the friend chicken strips were bland, the mac and cheese was too greasy and gooey, the fries were "meh" and the sauces seemed to be nothing special at all. Now that being said, it was not bad, just not good.
I didn't quite love this place as much as fellow Yelpers, but then again maybe it had to do with ordering the baked strips instead of the fried ones.  They were good but didn't make me go wow.  I had probably over hyped them for myself when I heard stories about the sizes of the strips.

 Not one to dwell on the negatives though, the mac and cheese was delicious as was the side of chicken nachos that were on sale that day.  The owner was friendly and made sure that service was great.  Last but not least, there's definitely a good selection of sauces, so if something is not to your liking, next time you can try a different one!  While I wasn't a fan of the Wasabi Sauce, the BFG sauce was particularly good.  I look forward to coming back and trying some of the different styles and sides at least.
Well, what is there to say that hasn't already been said?

I love BFG!! I like their simple menu, and I have to say that my favorite is the fried chicken strips because they are coated with Panko, which are Japanese style bread crumbs. I also love the baked Mac and cheese, which is always hot and creamy! The combos are reasonably priced, comes with the right amount of food, and includes a drink. They have nine different sauces to choose from, which is great! 

What really stands out about this place is the customer service. Jin is just awesome! He is very friendly, talks to all of his customers, and tries to remember everyone by name. You have to admit that it is rare to see that level of service anywhere nowadays! 

Don't forget your stamp card! Buy 10 combos, get one free! You can also check their website for weekly specials.
Great food. Baked Mac n Cheese is delicious.  Definitely try the Wasabi Cream sauce.  Can't wait to go back.
they do have good fried chicken strips and the mac and cheese are good as well.

The baked chicken strips are good but, def not tasty as the fried chicken strips.

The grilled veggies were boring and could have been more creative but, can't complain for a meal under $6.

It's sort of hard to find but, if you are in the neighborhood you should def give it a try.
BFG was amazing! Fellow yelper Ramil B. introduced me to this place and it was awesome. 

BFG stands for Baked, Fried, Grilled which are the 3 options for how to have your chicken strips. They have a variety of sauces to accompany including "Wasabi Cream." Sides for the chicken are fries, grilled vegetables, garlic bread and mac&cheese. There's something for those who come just to stuff their face and something for the more health conscious.

The owner, Jin, is super friendly and he definitely makes it his mission to have a relationship with each of his customers.

The artwork on the walls are cute and inviting.

This is a great mom&pop shop. A definite cane's replacement. In fact, they are even cheaper than cane's! I LOVE THAT!

Speaking of canes, I could choose BFG's garlic bread over Cane's texas toast ANY DAY, HANDS DOWN. The garlic bread is smaller, but it tastes way better.

Only downfall, it's nowhere near my house. HAHA.
I'm so glad I finally got the opportunity to try this place out today!

I came with my mom for a late lunch after a full day of shopping. We shared the grilled chicken strips with veggie skewers and the fried chicken strips with the baked mac n cheese. Everything was out of this world delicious and the service was so incredibly friendly and welcoming. I'm a big fan of the fried strips, but I think I almost liked the grilled ones a little better. The mac n cheese was phenomenal and super duper cheesy. Just how I like it. They have an incredible sauces too! My favorite was the wasabi cream. So perfect!

The food was incredible, so was the service and on top of all that the prices were beyond reasonable for the quality and quantity that you get. Winner winner, chicken dinner! I'll be back... and soon!
Mac and Cheese was awesome! This place is really good.  It is worth the drive if you are just visiting Vegas, and if you are a local, what are you waiting on?  Try it already!!!
So i tried this place recently going off the reviews I have seen and omg I see why every ones giving it 4 or 5 stars this place is awesome!

The chicken is good quality very juicy and tender and the breading on the fried chicken strips is different and unique very tasty. You get your choice of two dipping sauces i got ranch and the BFG sauce both were very tasty and as my side dish i got the baked mac n cheese mmm mmm good. 

This place is a hit they serve great food, fast service, at a great price I will definitely be returning here again!
After a barrage of phone calls from my brother who was introduced to BFG (by our sister and BIL), Hubs and I just knew we had to check it out.  

Sadly we didn't bring our little guy with us (he had plans!) but we did pick up the Baked Strips and Mac n Cheese to go and that lil bugga MOWED down the mac n cheese en route to the airport...and asked for MORE!

We chose their fried strips and grilled strips and both had to admit that their fried chicken strips are the best that we've ever had.  The coating on fried strips are light and flaky, exactly how anything battered really should be. We sampled their wasabi cream (yum), buffalo, ranch and the BFG sauces...all delish!

Their french fries are amazing.  The Hubs was giving me a stink eye the entire time since I was hijacking those fried potato morsels and in reality, I should have opted for the less healthier choice rather than their grilled veggies (I'm not a fan of onions!).

The garlic bread is yummy, very nicely flavored.  

A big standout really (aside from the food) is service.  I am not high maintanence by any means but I really did enjoy having Jin come by and check on us.  I noticed that he greeted everyone that walked in and took the time to chat with the patrons in there which made it such "welcome to our place" feeling.  THAT you have to love.  Jin gets major props for just being awesome.

Would be come back?  Yes we have to now since our lil man tasted the mac and cheese and the the strips and is addicted now.  And for the record, now that we are back home, our lil guy was more than happy to know he had some chicken strips to bring for lunch to school.
I think macaroni and cheese with fried chicken strips is one of those unsung, tasty food combinations.  And here it is done perfectly.  The panko breading was so light and crispy.  Mix in a little wasabi cream sauce and you will be in heaven.

If you are looking for something light, they offer grilled strips with grilled vegetables.  I didn't try these because I can't say no to fried chicken with mac and cheese.  All the combos come with yummy garlic bread. TVs were playing the football game.  What else can you ask for really?
Really good food for a great price
The food here is pretty good. The mac and cheese is creamy and the chicken strips are awesome. The service is good and the price is fair. They have a bunch of sauces as well so there is probably going to be something for everybody. If you eat inside they have whatever game happens to be on which is great.
This could possibly be my favorite place to eat in all of Vegas.

It's located in a strip mall on the NW corner of Charleston and Rainbow- which is right in my neighborhood, making it one of the only restaurants I frequent near my home.

The owner, Jin, is seriously the friendliest person I've met. He knows everyone's name- seriously, everyone! He always remembers me and everyone else who comes here, which makes us all keep coming back!

So now, about the food.. These chicken strips are delicious. I've tried all three varieties. The baked have so much flavor, and the grilled are great too. My favorite is the fried. These are not your typical American chicken strips- battered, sodium laden, and fried. These chicken strips are panko breaded and fried to perfection- coming out steaming hot, crispy on the outside, and perfectly moist on the inside.

I like to pair my chicken strips with a side of their incredible mac and cheese. They make it extra special by melting some fresh cheese on the top of your portion- adding some texture and oozing cheese fun!

Their french fries are great too, crispy and flaky. They obviously know what they're doing, unlike in-n-out burger, whose fries are chewy and flavorless.

Their choices of dipping sauces beat the pants off any fast food restaurant, especially your average McDonalds or Chic-Fil-A. It's fun to experiment with different flavor combinations with your strips- and it'll keep you coming back.

The prices are also extremely low. You will leave here satiated for only a few bucks. The thing that impressed me was how you can add more strips to your meal for low price as well. And an extra side of mac and cheese is only a buck fifty. Score!!

Try this place- it's more than a hipster teenager hang out. To me, it's the best bang for your buck in Vegas. If you're looking for some good food cheap, BFG is your place.
I'm a huge fan of chicken fingers, so I'll be a bit more critical. I liked the fact that they have healthy alternatives and an easy set-up for ordering, but I wasn't blown away. The service was excellent for a tiny sit-down quick stop type restaurant, but other than that, that's all that was memorable.
I know part of the experience is the customer serverice here, unfortunately we got our food to go, fried chicken with Mac n cheese, and grilled chicken with fries. We ordered teriyaki, buffalo, honey mustard, and BFG sauce. My favorite was the honey mustard and BFG for the fried chicken and teriyaki for the grilled.
The fried chicken is breaded and fried like fish and chips, it was really good, the mac n cheese seemed like Krafts with cheese on top and baked.. It was really good that way. Fries were awesome, found myself dipping them in the BFG sauce a lot! The garlic bread is not Texas toast so just expect French roll style garlic bread. I love Cane's chicken too what makes this stand out is the choices. I think I'll try the nachos next go around.
Pretty good and good prices.  Kind of busy! And the mac and cheese is delish
Really 3 stars but the owner is sooo nice I'll round up! This is a small fast food joint with solid food. The chicken is great; both the fried and baked are delicious. Are the the best chicken fingers I've ever had? No they are certainly not, but satisfying none the less! The mac and cheese is hot and bubbly, though I don't see what all the fuss is about. Maybe because so many places make nasty mac and cheese here, we're all excited to see a place that doesn't mess it up? It's good but not life changing, world shattering, slap yo momma, marriage material mac and cheese. Again the owner was so sweet and checked on every table. He knew regulars by name and could spot a first timer from a mile away. Extra star for service! All in all I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here except maybe for a quick mac and cheese fix, but would definitely stop if I was driving by.
This restaurant was one of the best macaroni I ever had and the fried chicken was good. I first thought this was going to be Like any restaurant that makes okay meals but it made excellent meals. If you ever tried Kane's and like Kane's, you are going to love this. They had a pretty normal menu so I stuck with what I know is good and that is fried chicken with bread. But if you are to buy anything you have to buy the macaroni since that turns the restaurant from a 3 star to a 5 star. Its not a fancy restaurant  and it has foam cups but it is a fast food restaurant .its right next to a comic store. Just to tell you when I was walking I looked inside the comic store next door and grown men where playing dungeons and dragons with there costumes on and I  can't believe that they were grown men. But anyways you should  try this restaurant if you want to try something new.
As far as fast food goes, this place is pretty good, hence the four stars.  Don't expect anything gourmet, simply fried chicken tenders and some homemade sauces.  I liked the wasabi sauce myself, that was the best thing about the whole experience actually.  The owner of the place was there handling the cashier.  Pretty cool guy, and  I really like supporting local businesses.
Came here with my boyfriend. I'm a fan of raising canes but my boyfriend kept telling me how good BFG is so we drove ten miles just to get there! I ordered baked mac & cheese and chicken strip combo! Wow! The chicken strips are so juicy and delicious!! I like the panko coatin. It's so light and you don't feel greasy at all. Fries are hot and crunchy!! Love it so much:)) 

I had BBQ sauce and chili sauce. BBQ is no different than that BBQ sauce,sweet chili sauce is surprisingly good!!! For the baked Mac & cheese, I love the mozzarella topping. All food are reasonably priced! The only con is it's too far from where I live ;( the store owner Jin is really friendly too, as mentioned in other review! Will definitely come back when I'm around that area!!!:))))
I love BFG's panko fried chicken strips! It reminds me of the fried seafood mix I used to eat at Osaka's in San Diego. They just fried up scallops and fake crab sticks instead....sorry back to the chicken! It was crispy and tender on the inside. I tried the Wasabi and the Honey Mustard sauce. I enjoyed the Honey Mustard more because it wasn't bitter like the Wasabi. I also loved the veggie kabobs which were full of flavor! I ordered the Mac and Cheese as an additional side but I couldn't finish it. It was creamy and cheesy but too salty for me. I just have a low tolerance to salt.

I liked the idea that you can come here with someone  who is health conscious aka my husband. You can totally order healthy items like grilled chicken and veggies. It's a great alternative to typical fast food places like KFC.
While I was out getting ready to go to a party... We wanted to eat first "just in case", and we were right. (There was food at the party but mainly drinks. The food wasn't finished being cooked till after we left.)  So anyway, back the restaurant ...The people who work there are super nice, they always get an extra star for going out of their way. (I think his name was Jason) We ordered 2 Hot Chicks, fries, vegetables, and two drinks. The price came out to be a little over 10. The Hot Chick was great if I wasn't trying to watch my figure I would have ate 2-3 easy. While the food is not gourmet, nether is the price, but still taste great! 

I hope they make the Hot Chick part of their menu. I was thinking when looking at the menu that they should expand it, like adding Chicken sandwich and Hot Chick to the line up.
I party in Vegas alot and this is always a must when I'm here. Whether its a pregame dinner before drinking and clubbing or as an early lunch before drinking at the pool parties, the food is on point. Give me some grilled strips with mac n cheese and I'm ready to roll! Some of the best and friendliest customer service you could also experience as well. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas Memorial Weekend :)
Found out about this place through my older brother. 

Definitely has one of the best chicken strips out there  and their mac & cheese was to die for :) You can pick a sauce of your choice but I would definitely recommend the wasabi cream ( if you have no problem with wasabi). The chili sauce was good too. 

Great food, reasonable prices and great service!
The best chicken strip in town
Sorry for the raisin cane, I tried both, but BFG is the best in town not you guys
And the owner of the BFG, Jin, is super friendly and super nice. The best thing about their customer service is they they remember all of their customers' names really amazing
I went there all the time when i am studying at csn charleston campus
I love this place. It gives me an understanding of how things used to be. The owner goes out of his way to know everyones name. The food is outstanding and comes in portions that the body is SUPPOSED to intake at one seating. Great friendly atmosphere. Even if the food weren't so amazing, I'd go just to hang out with Jin (owner). Two thumbs and one big toe up!!
A few years ago, we stumbled into BFG after reading yelp reviews.  Every time has been simply fantastic.  The chicken is always perfectly prepared in whatever form.  Baked, Fried, or Grilled. (BFG get it?)   The perfection of the chicken strip, what ever the cooking method  would easily make for a 5 star review, but wait, let's talk about the mac and cheese.  Bubbly hot, silky smooth and simply delicious. From the first mouth searing bite to the bitter end of licking the bowl clean, it is simply heaven. Woo-Hoo this sounds good, but wait, there is a another layer to drool over, the signature dipping sauces.   My personal favorite is the Wasabi cream.  Just enough heat to bring the tears, but so good you can't stop.  Bring  a straw and love the burn.  The thai sweet chili is very unique with a mild heat and a multitude of flavorful back tones. The honey mustard is subtle and is a nice counterpoint to the more powerful flavors mentioned above.  If you prefer something a bit more mellow,there are several more varieties for your consideration

We have perfectly prepared chicken, exceptional side dishes and incredible dipping sauces, what else could you ask for?  How about an owner that is the penultimate example of customer service?  If you come in every day or once a year, Jin always remembers your name and what you like, he personally greets you and makes you feel at home.

  It doesn't get much better than this
I just went this week end with a friend.  The food was great !  Price was better !!  Service was very friendly and quick.  The place was nice and clean.  I can't think of one thing to gripe about this place, it was great for lunch or a quick dinner.
Wasabi cream in the a baked chicken strip seasoned with a rotisserie seasoning. Was good. Panko bread crumbs on the fried one was missing something. Baked mac n cheese? Was baked mac n cheese. It was good. But how great do u expect it to b. I also had a try at their bfg dipping sauce. It was..hmm ok. A tangy thousand island is what they said it was. I will try something else next time. But this visit was average for me. Great idea but i think they have room to improve.
Here is my dream.  Take a certain texas garlic toast from another chain and bring it here to combine with the best chicken strips this side of the farm.  The fried strips had the lightest breading I have tasted.  The baked macaroni is cheesy with the perfect crust of cheese across the top.  They also have baked and grilled chicken (the B and the G of BFG).  They also have several choices of sauce, honey mustard, ranch, BFG (their take on russian), BBQ, and several others.
Too bad their garlic bread is a small oval piece of buttered bread with garlic salt on top.  It kept this place from a 5 star rating.  That and how small the place is.
came here after reading all the yelp reviews... all i gotta say is.. BEST MAC AND CHEESE PERIOD. seriously, this is how god intended mac and cheese to taste like and if u havent had mac and cheese from here, u havent tried mac and cheese.. BOMB DIGGITY
Great atmosphere. Great mac & cheese!!! Decent prices. Small place wouldn't stay to eat there often but take out is quick and easy.
This place is the best chicken in town! 

I had the fried chicken with the sweet chili, and buffalo. Made fresh to order, light crispy, so moist, it was the best!

Let's talk the Mac n cheese. I've never had better, even after finishing I wanted to lick the bowl. 

The French fries were hot crispy and flavorful. I can't wait to go back and eat there again.
Awesome Mac & Cheese!

SITREP

I have to give mad props to both my Vegas Yelp-buds Anthony and Jade since they turned me onto the GREAT CHEEESY establishment BFG Chicken Strips while I was hangin with them in Vegas for the Yelp Convention back in May 2012.

THE MAC MENU

Mac N' Cheese here is TRULY an ultimate "Classic American Eats", as a SIDE dish OR get a BUNCH like I did at just under $2 a pop, and why not? - I took them back to my hotel room at the Stratosphere one late night and make it a MAIN dish.  Mmmm, delish!

SPECIAL PREPARATION!

BFG Chicken Strips meets a cheesaholic's strict-standards of "cheesification".  They make incredible BAKED Mac N' Cheese in individual containers with a Mozzarella Crust!  (HOLY HELL.  I feel my arteries hardening with joy just thinking about this festive cheesapalooza!)

THE LOWDOWN

If you are looking for a Mac n' Cheese fix, look no further.
Very good stuff! Had the fried strip combo which includes a side, dipping sauce and small drink. All under $5 bucks!

Mac and cheese was also good stuff.

All food was made to order, very hot a plus for me.
Food so good it put me to sleep. First time at this place and the food may have just made me a regular. Fried chicken strips were nice and crispy. The BFG and wasabi cream are awesome together, and separately try mixing it. The Mac and cheese is like crack. I wanted more after I finished it.
Decided to give this place a try based on all of the great reviews. Upon entrance, very clean. Service was quick and the staff were friendly. The food: I ordered the family pack which consisted of 25 strips (baked/grilled), fries, veggie kabobs, and mac & cheese. The strips were just ok. Nothing special. Mac & cheese was bland but I loved the cheese topping. I loved the veggie kabobs and TX toast. Fries were just ok. Tried all of the different sauces and my fav was the BFG & Honey Mustard sauce. Overall, I probably would not come back.
We had 2 4piece combos for ~14.

- seems asian owned. great fried chicken! panko. tender. served fresh. better than raising canes. better deal.
- baguette garlic toast?! from lees sandwiches? lol
- crispy thin french fries. good portion.
- mac and cheese. very cheesy! no kraft!
- nice art! chicken is cute. 
- ice thai coffee? haven't tried it, but sounds interesting.
- nujabes music in bg?! niceee :)
I've been there 3x already, and the owner never remembers my name. What's up with that? lol jk. 

Move over, Raising Cane's. I have found a new joint for chicken strips. Their menu is simple and limited, but you can't go wrong with anything there. You can choose your chicken strips to be baked, fried, or grilled, hence the name BFG. You also get to choose 2 sauces for your strips. I liked my grilled chicken with teriyaki sauce and the fried strips with their wasabi cream sauce. For the sides, the baked mac n cheese is to die for (sooo cheesy), and their shoe-string fries are really crispy and tasty as well. If you want to go healthy, choose the grilled veggies. 

PS: Please bring back the weekly specials! I miss the nachos lol
This place is all I really live for. Every time I get paid, it's the first place I come. I always get the 4 strip combo with fried strips and the Mac n cheese. It all taste good, gets you full, and is at a great price! I love BFG!
Five stars for the baked mac and cheese and wasabi cream alone. Everything else is good, as well.
Came from San Diego and brought the family again.  Phone recording said they were open on Sundays.  We went there.  They were not open.  Bummer.  Went on Monday, but I guess we missed the regular guys that work there.  Everything a bit dirty, and not the usual "feeling".  No daily special either.  Bummer.  All was good as usual, but I left feeling I should have got a salad too.  Wasabi cream and sweet chili dips are the best, still.  Iced Thai great the next morning.  Still loving the light panko crust and the kids are still loving the mac n cheese.  I think next time I'll buy extra and sell some to the conventioneers were with.  They still need to go green to much disposable stuff.  I wish they were open later.
I love this place!  I have been coming here for  18 months or more and is still one of my favoriate places for lunch.  The food is fresh and cooked to perfection.  I have tried all three chicken options but like the grilled the best.  My little girl loves the mac and cheese and french fries.  Service is always top notch.  Portion size is just right and for the price, a great value. Keep up the great work!
Here's the cool thing about BFG: customization.  Unlike Chick-Fil-A and Raising Canes, BFG is a small and quaint restaurant that can be easily missed, tucked away in a plaza, and doesn't draw a lot of attention, except for the unusual design of its exterior.  However, unlike Chick-Fil-A and Raising Canes, you make your order in steps, which allows for multiple combinations of your meal, and is something that I like:

Step 1: Chicken
You can order either baked, fried, or grilled chicken strips.  I ordered the fried, panko-crusted, chicken strips.  I was surprised how small each chicken strips were (so if you're hungry, order the 4-piece combo).  However, what they lacked in size, they made up for in quality.  The chicken strips were very meaty, very moist for white-meat, and the panko-crust made the strips feel light and a healthier choice as opposed to flour-crusted chicken strips.  Hint: fried chicken strips go especially well with the wasabi cream sauce.

Step 2: Side dish
I've yet to try the baked mac & cheese and the grilled veggies, but the fries were pretty good.  I ordered to-go, so unfortunately, the heat and steam in the box made the fries soggy and less enjoyable, but I could still taste how potato-ey they were.  Hint: if you're going to order fries, don't order it to-go.

Step 3: Sauce
BFG offers a plethora of sauces (Remember?  I like having choices).  I ordered the BFG and Wasabi cream sauce.  The Wasabi cream is hands-down the better of the two.  It has a touch of sweetness and a touch of spiciness, but is at a level anyone can tolerate.  I highly recommend it.  The BFG sauce wasn't as special.  It tasted similar to Thousand Islands.

Step 4: Drink
Nothing different from other fast food restaurants.  Although, I bet you can switch out the drink in the order for Thai Iced Coffee for a little extra.

Last, but not least, BFG has especially quick service.  I got my meal in about 5 minutes.  Good food, fast service.
Love this place!   Best chicken strips in town.  My kids are addicted and I love how affordable it is.
outstanding second visit as good as 1st time excellent food great chicken strips people are so nice  would go again and again will tell everybody although they need a biger combo than 4 piece maybe a ten piece please
Wasabi Sauce is a must try!!! Great kick!! Fried Chicken was Delicious! A definite must try!
Awesome chicken, veggies and mac & cheese. My girls always want to come here and the remember your name. Great service great food...... Thanks guys.
Good food, decent price.  Many sauces to choose from.  If you are looking for a healthy and good finger, this is the place.
These are the best chicken strips I've ever had. I order the baked strips, grilled veggies and wasabi cream and chili sauce. It's fantastic every single time. Service is quick (which is good since lunch time is crowded). It's a very small place so be prepared to either wait for a table or just order to go. The bakes mac and cheese is also great, especially if you throw some of their buffalo sauce on top! 

You should try BFG, they're great.
Don't believe the hype! I won't say this place is awful, but it's nothing to write home about.

I heard about BFG over a year ago, and I kind of forgot about it. It resurfaced in my mind a few days ago, and I just had to try it. 

Maybe I expected too much? I ordered the baked chicken. with the mac and cheese. Don't expect to just walk in and get your food in a minute or two. You'll be waiting a few, especially if they are busy. It's completely worth it though..  the food was still steaming by the time I got to my house in the Aliante area. I was impressed.

My order consisted of baked chicken with honey mustard and BFG sauce, and the mac and cheese. The chicken was fine. Nothing that I couldn't prepare myself. The mac and cheese was completely disappointing! It looks so good from the pictures I've seen, but it was complete bland. A soupy mac and cheese covered in cheese. Boring! The best thing on my plate was the honey mustard sauce. That's kinda sad....

The service is awesome. The staff is really friendly! I think I paid just under $7 bucks, which really wasn't bad. I just wish the good was better.
You had me at Panko! Fried chicken strips with choice of buffalo or wasabi cream sauce, a side of fries and a drink... a good tasty meal deal. I'm not a big fan of wasabi in general, but this sauce had me dipping for more. It was kickin sweet and worth the try.

Menu is simple, prices are great and food is tasty. Will be coming back for more!
Chicken with benefits... or maybe options. That is the essence of BFG. This is high quality chicken, with a bunch of sauces. Admit it, you know that sauce is boss. It can make or break the deal. Luckily, if it breaks the deal in this case - it's probably your fault.

As the name says, you have options of baked, fried, or grilled chicken strips. I opt for grilled more often than not. I pick some veggies on the side, and I profit. I devour these plates. It is simple and delicious. If you're feeling a little less healthy than I am, you should definitely opt for fried, get a side of mac and cheese, and chow down. You always have a choice. Deep.

Stop in! It might be a little hard to spot, being next to a Home Depot, but it's worth the search.
Panko crusted chicken strips are 4.5 stars!! Everything else is ok...
Like many kids, our boys love chicken strips.  Dad and boys brought home the family meal while making a Home Depot run, so we tried it all.
Nothing special with the baked and grilled tenders or the fries/bread/veggies.   The mac and cheese is pretty darn good though!  We had about 6 sauces and our favorites were the unique ones:  wasabi, BFG, buffalo and sweet chili.  We'll definitely be back for those panko babies!!
I had to see what the hype was about these chicken strips.  My friend and I stopped here on the way to the outlets.  It's a pretty small place with a few tables, but it wasn't very busy when we arrived.  I ordered four individual strips so we could try all of them, while she ordered the grilled strips meal with a side of mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was really good!  The cheese on top was baked well, and the cheese inside was very creamy.  It's probably fake cheese, but I like fake cheese.  The strips themselves were very moist but a little small.  We tried the bakes, fried, and grilled strips.  My favorite was, of course, the fried.  The batter was light and crisp - I think someone said the breading is panko?  We got two sauce, the Chili Thai and the BFG sauce, which is similar to Thousand Island.  The Chili Thai sauce was dark brown rather than red and had a kick to it, but it was good.  I liked it more than the BFG sauce.  However, I do think that the sauce at Raisin' Cane's is the best.  We also ordered the Thai Ice Coffee.  My friend really liked it bc it wasn't very sweet, whereas I had to put more sugar in mine.  Thai Iced Coffee is  usually pretty sweet, but this one wasn't.  Overall, it was a good meal for under $7, though if you're hungry, you better order a bunch of strips!
Yummy. Had the grilled and panko chicken strips both very good. The grilled strips have a sweet honey marinade flavor. The panko strips were light, breading was not heavy or greasy. Tried the mac and cheese which was ok. The mozzarella crust on top was good but the mac and cheese part was a bit too rich in cheddar flavor. Tasted like velveeta. The grilled veggies weren't bad. A good healthy option. Even though it's off the strip, I'd go again next time I'm in Vegas.
Really good! Fast, too! And, they are so friendly! Will definitely be back.
If you have a hankering for chicken strips this is the place to go!  Lots of options for dipping sauces and perfect atmosphere for kids!
B(aked) F(ried) G(rilled) .. ahh hah! ..BFG..The concept where you get to choose the way your chicken is cooked, baked, fried or grilled  sounded cool..!!...Im not  a big chicken strip eater but wanted to see what was the big deal about this place.

Both Mr. B. and I  ordered ours fried. Since Im a fan of panko crusted anything this chicken strip was already a plus in my book. Chicken was juicy and flavorful.  The mac n cheese side was oozing comfort food, hot and cheesey.  My grilled veggies were good as well! Counter service staff was super friendly. The boss was there and true to the many reviews, he acknowledged and greeted almost every customer even though he was clearly busy. 

All I got to say is that both Mr. B and I are happy we did check this place  out while we were in the area. BFG won me over and now Im a fan of chicken strips, at least the way they are made here!
It's been a while since I wrote my initial review for BFG but I went back a few days ago and some things have changed so I'm updating.

1st off, ownership of the place has changed so that was kind of a shocker because I was so accustomed to Jin and his awesome customer service. The new staff is cool and the customer service is average now but in my old review I mentioned that I felt like a friend or a family member rather than just a customer. That statement is no longer true. It is because of this reason that my rating has dropped.

NOT TO WORRY THOUGH.

Nothing about the food has changed. Everything I have said about the food before still remains true. It's still awesome and still worth the trip. Good eats fellow Yelpers :)
WINNER! WINNER! CHICKEN (STRIPS) DINNER!

Looks like Raising Cane's just might have some competition! When you think of chicken strips, what comes to mind is deep fried battered chicken strips. Traditionally, that's what has always been known. 

But then this place turns it up a notch, actually two notches, not just by offering you FRIED, but also GRILLED and BAKED as well. 

It's not just your typical battered fried, but they use PANKO breading, which makes it very crispy on the outside while it stays juicy on the inside. 

At first I thought the GRILLED would be kind of dry, but with the first bite, I was pleasantly suprised at how tender and juicy it was with the taste of Asian marinade and honey.

Same goes for the BAKED. It has a wonderful rotisserie flavor to it.

As for the sides, you have BAKED MAC N CHEESE, FRENCH FRIES, and GRILLED VEGGIES. You can't go wrong with these selections but make sure at least one of your choices is the baked mac n cheese. Not only is it what you expect, but they also put MOZZARELLA on top of it!

Of course you gotta have a sauce to dip you chicken strips in so here's the lowdown.
You get your choice of 9 sauces. (in alphabetical order)

1. Barbeque
2. BFG
3. Buffalo
4. Cheese 
5. Honey Mustard
6. Ranch
7. Sweet Chili
8. Teriyaki
9. Wasabi Cream

These are all self explantory except for BFG and Wasabi Cream.
The BFG is there secret signature sauce comparable to Raising Canes. The Wasabi Cream tastes just like a sweet, cream cheese type of sauce with just a little bit of spicy kick of wasabi.

Since this is the only location in existence, any time you are in the area, try to take advantage if you are close by. If you are gonna dine in be aware that they only have about 6 tables inside and about 3 tables outside. They are located to the left of Home Depot.

All in all, I would definitely go back and recommend this place to anybody. Service was nice and they get your food out to you pretty quick. The one only negative I can say is that the strips are just a tad bit small. If you are really hungry, you just might have to order extra strips or sides to compensate. 

So what are you doing still reading this review? Go already! What are you, chicken? LOL.
Pros:
Great customer service (friendly, prompt, social, stickers for children)
Great prices ($20 for 2 adult meals, kids meal and 2 extra strips)
Great strips (grilled and baked are actually better than the fried)
Great sauces (sweet chili all the way!)

Cons:
Mac and cheese looks much better than it tastes. Pretty average actually.
Strips are not very big (order extra).

Overall a great place....I will be back on future trips to vegas.
omg best place eveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer. I love you bfg
Our usual trips to Vegas always include a stop at BFG but we were sad to discover on this trip that the ownership has changed hands.  Jin apparently sold the spot and has moved on.  Man, I'm seriously going to miss that guy, he was way awesome and made our chicken strip dining experience amazing each and everytime.

Another negative is that the prices have gone up a bit.  But thankfully the food quality is still the same.  The customer service is definitely nowhere near the level that Jin provided and for that, it gets docked a star but the food is still solid and they still serve the best chicken strips in Vegas!

Wasabi Cream still reigns supreme, GET IT!
Read the reviews and had to try it out, I liked the fact that they give you the option of baked, grilled or fried. I ordered the baked strips with a side of grilled veggies, and my husband had the fried fingers with a side of Mac and cheese. Pretty darn tasty! My husband literally inhaled the Mac and cheese. We had ranch and buffalo sauce for dipping and they were both good. We went right before lunch hour rush and it was already busy. It's not a big establishment and there's not many spots for seating. Because its so small, once it's packed it feels like people are hovering over your table while you eat, so I would say that's the biggest downfall.
I really wish I lived in Las Vegas. I would eat at this place all the time.

This place has a small menu, and everything on it, they do right. The prices were incredible, too! We ordered a whole bunch of food, got plenty full, and only spent $14!

Before I start, BEST GRILLED VEGETABLES EVER. Perfectly cooked, great grill marks, fresh, tasty veg. YAY!!! If you like spicy, grab the sriracha on the counter and squeeze it on the veggies. A-mazing.

The fried chicken strips, with a crispy panko crust, are the best. Our next favorite were the grilled, followed by the baked. They were all plenty good, though!

Their sauces were awesome. Loooved the honey mustard. BBQ sauce was good!

The baked mac and cheese is really cheesy--medium cheddar sauce, mozzarella crust. Rich, but it's a small side portion and ends up being perfect.

Service was great too--the employees looked like they might be a bunch of punks, but they were super polite and courteous and even made friendly small talk with us as they came around and cleaned up tables! They even remembered that we were in town on a road trip when they came out and chatted with us about that. Good employees!!!

Everything was so good. My stomach is growling writing this. Why am I 500 miles away?! We'll be back next time we're in town for sure. Wish they did desserts! I bet they'd do really good ones.
This was a fun little place that has a testy thing going for it. In Las Vegas in early December for the Rock n' Roll Marathon we discovered all the things a chicken can do! Ok, not ALL but many ways one can choose to cook it. BFG means baked, fried, grilled and I surprisingly really liked everything ordered. Here's the run down, baked and fried chicken, both moist and good flavor. Baked Mac n' Cheese, comes in a small mini pie tin. It's very cheesy! And unexpectedly the best item was the nachos! Really good. Tip: ask for a side of BBQ sauce and drizzle it on top of the nachos for a little more enjoyment. The owners name is Matt, he said he was "Chicken Charlie's cousin!" He's VERY friendly.
Good food!

Went with the fried and grilled sets.  Both were good, but I liked the fried ones best....the breading is soft and yummy, and chicken is tender on both.

The real winner here are the sauces.  If I was eating everything without the sauces, it would be pretty boring IMO.  They have a handful of sauces, and our favs were the wasabi and the sweet chili.  The honey mustard was good, as was the teriyaki.

And the mac and cheese is very good!  Easily the best mac and cheese that isn't in a gourmet setting that I have enjoyed so far.

The baby loved all the food, and had tons of fun dipping into all the goodies here.  Should be a cool place to bring the little ones!

And just like everyone else said, the portions of chicken are a little on the small side...the 4 piece combo filled me up for the most part, but don't expect Canes sizes or you should be ordering extra pieces.  They really just need to offer a 6 piece combo, and I think that will fill up most everybody.

And the service for a fast food joint was very good.  Friendly counterstaff, talkative, and they even checked on us during and after the meal.  Drop something in their tip cup!

We will be back :)
Truly one of the best little places in Vegas. Clean and well priced, this restaurant has a simple menu but everything is spectacular. I will admit, I'm not easy to please, when it comes to food, but this place is great.
Fried crispy goodness! I can't comment on the baked or grilled chicken because I can't get past ordering the fried! The breading is a very light panko mixture and it makes for some juicy chicken fingers. The sauces I'm still trying out, but the standouts are the BFG sauce, the teriyaki and the honey mustard. The accompanying garlic bread is consistently fresh. The mac and cheese comes out hot and gooey and tasting like homemade. It's a generous portion although it's so good I rarely leave any leftovers. My latest trip here was immediately following a 90 minute massage from the best foot spa and I must say it was a magical night! The price is perfect and there's never a long wait. The employees are overtly friendly and seem genuinely interested in you enjoying their establishment. What's not to love?
My new fave American food in town. My hubby and I like to search yelp and see what is a 4 1/2 to 5 star place and try it. No matter how far it is. That's what brought us from Henderson to Rainbow and 95. 

We were greeted by a friendly person who ended up being one of the owners, Matt. I noticed right away that he really did have a passion for what he does. I think that the most successful people differ from the others because of their passion. With his help, we ordered the family meal which more than fed me, hubby, syd, cam, and luke. And might I add that we are all big eaters and all have active Yelp profiles detailing our eating escapades (except for luke, he's 3). First, the baked mac n cheese was a revelation. I can make some good stuff, but this one closely rivals my own personal recipe. It's sooo delish. The fries and the veggies were stellar. The chicken comes in 3 styles: baked with rotisserrie season, fried with panko, and grilled with asian marinade. My hubby asked which I liked the best and I couldn't even choose. 

They are embarking on a catering biz, too. We have committed to Matt to use him for the whole next year of kid birthday parties. This is the perfect food for a crowd, or to drop into for a quick lunch. 

They are located next to Home Depot on the garden side. I would recommend them to anyone that likes homestyle food that's hot and fresh.
I can't believe how many times I passed this little place in the last few years. I worked 5 minutes away from this place and never stopped. I remember thinking chicken strips? What? Boo!  Instead of stopping at BFG, I ate at several other mediocre spots in the area. Shame on me for being a HATER!

A few weeks ago, one of my coworkers had lunch at her desk and it smelled terrific. I peeked in, and asked what she was eating. She told me she was eating grilled chicken and veggies from BFG. She then proceeded to tell me that you can order your chicken baked, fried, or grilled. I then made it a point to review it on yelp and noticed all the wonderful reviews this place received.
 
This past weekend, my family and I wanted to try something different. I suggested BFG, and off we went. At this point, I still didn't put it together that the place I was searching for was the same place I dissed time and time again. 
When we pulled up, I was like oh -this place? We ran in because it was freezing cold outside, and ordered the family special. 

We ordered 10 fried strips, 5 baked, and 5 grilled. I can't even make an argument on which version was better. I loved them all equally--just like my kids!  The baked chicken was seasoned perfectly, and no dipping sauces were needed.   I added a dash of hot sauce to the grilled chicken and I was in heaven. The best thing about eating the fried strips was the Chile sauce that was available for dipping. Oh man-that was good! 

The sides were good too! The baked mac n cheese was done perfectly, and the fries were crispy and delicious. The garlic bread was mediocre, but who cares!  I have never seen my kids eat so fast.... 

Co-owner Matt was super friendly and even gave us a sample of their chicken nachos to try! He mentioned that they were starting to cater on the side. Immediately, my wife booked him for our daughter's birthday in February. Oh, and my Son's birthday in April! Sorry Matt--you asked for it! 

I love this place! Chicken strips at their best!
I consider myself a regular here. (I'm not sure if Yelp does just yet!) I won't get into the details of how good the food is because there are so many other reviews that share sentiments that I can co-sign for. I will say that there is a noticeable difference in the environment since the new ownership has taken over. I like the direction and exuberance that the new guys have. The customer service is sincere and genuine and they constantly want to know what they can do to better serve their clientele. To me, these are signs of a successful business in the making. Well, it already is! Cheers.
This tiny little place is soon to become one of my favorite chicken joints.

BFG stands for Baked, Fired, Grilled.  The chicken strips here are, obviously, served 3 ways...

I have tried fried & grilled and I am impressed with the flavor.  The wasabi cream dipping sauce is divine.  As for sides, I have tried & enjoyed only the grilled veggies (2 skewers of zucchinni, onions, & grape tomatoes) and the baked macaroni & cheese.  Again, very good flavor & 2 kinds of cheese on the mac & cheese.  The other item I have tasted isn't strictly in the BFG category : the Chicken Nachos.  Refer to Angela H.'s review on this item of which I wholeheartedly agree.  After I have tried more items and the quality remains consistent, I'll probably upgrade my rating to 5/5...

Last visit here I went with a 2 strip combo. This comes with 2 chicken strips (duh), one side, a dipping sauce, & a 12oz drink for $4.95 (I think).  I decided on the healthy route & got grilled strips (with some type of lightly sweet Asian marinade) and the grilled vegetables.  The taste was outstanding. 

The owner came out, knew the person I was with and remembered my face from my last visit.  He really wanted to know my name and it seems he is genuinely interested in pleasing his customers.

Lastly, it is open until 10 pm every day, so you can get your eat on relatively late.
A few weeks ago my in-laws were in town visiting, including my mother-in-law who is the pickiest person on the planet when it comes to food. One night there was a special request for chicken fingers, which resulted in me bookmarking BFG for future enjoyment, since the thought of panko-breaded fingers was too much for her to handle.

Last night the hubster and I were in the area, and decided to finally give it a try. We ordered a four and two finger combo, with four fried fingers and two baked fingers, one mac & cheese, fries, and three sauces - BBQ, BFG, and wasabi cream.

I wish we would have had a dozen of the baked fingers - they were honestly that good. Extremely moist, well-seasoned, and flavorful. They were even better with a bit of the wasabi cream (although I was hoping that the sauce would be slightly more pungent.

The fried fingers were a little disappointing. They were definitely crispy, and still moist, but I was surprised by the blandness. The BBQ sauce was pretty standard, but the BFG sauce was too sweet and 1000 Island-esq for my liking. The cheesy crust on the mac & cheese was nice, but I thought the noodles/sauce needed more seasoning.

Overall, this is a solid place, and I'll definitely be back when I'm in the neighborhood - specifically to get the baked fingers, wasabi cream, and probably the grilled veggies.
You have to order the 6pc as they aren't so big. This place is all about quality, best tasting chicken strips I have ever had. The baked Mac is awesome.
The staff here are AWESOME!! I would come back just to visit them haha.

I definitely enjoyed the food--the chicken was good, the sauces were varied and delicious. But I'm not a huge chicken strips person, so I can't get super excited about it. If you like chicken strips, you'll probably love it though!!
Okay, I've been going to BFG's since they first opened when I was in highschool and Jin still ran the place. A new management later and an improved menu, I'm still a die-hard fan of the chicken strips. Can't beat that, or their beer battered fries! Everyone who works there is super helpful and happy, and I love that they love their customers! They even remember names and orders, and post photos of customers on their facebook page. Very down to earth with out of this world food!
We decided to try this place after reading good reviews, We are glad we did.  The chicken strips are delicious,fresh,juicy made to order you can taste the freshness of the ingredients.  We met one of the owners, he was super nice and working just as hard as the rest of the guys there.  Since it was our first time eating there he offered to give us some  complimentary grilled chicken strips so we could try them since we had  ordered the fried ones.  After tasting we decided to order more and we also ordered the chicken nachos which were delicious too.  The place is very clean a little small though but that was not an issue since there wasn't many people when we went.  The portions are good. The mac and cheese is very good and fresh too. They are super nice and friendly and they care about their customers. I have to admit though we did feel a little out of place at first because their customers are mostly very young hip crowd. But We will definitely go back because they have good food at a good price.  We are soo glad we tried this place.
Thanks to my savvy yelping, I managed to to find this little gem when my friend and I were running to her bank on lunch break. While I was waiting on her, I hit the "nearby" button on the mobile app and BFG was right on top of the list.

We were in a rush so I read her the last couple of top tips on the place... She ordered the baked strips and I ordered 5 fried strips a la carte with ranch and wasabi cream (yelpers know everything - thanks guys for the tip)..

We took it to go, but drooled as we saw those dining in munching on their food. It was a tiny little place but the service was great (the guy that handed us our to go order - I really believed him when he said - Have a nice weekend).

Our food was piping hot and super moist and crunchy. I really liked it.

my ONLY complaint was I paid 40 cents a piece for the sauce and it was a tiny little cup that was barely half full. I mean - I barely had enough for 3 strips. Fill er up please for next time!!

I am definitely coming back though - and ordering the mac and cheese because every table in there (lol so like 6) had some mac and cheese on it and it looked amazing.

Definitely worth a try --- it was pretty awesome!
Unfortunately, this place isn't as good as it used to be, which is sad because it's convenient to a lot of places I have to go when I'm in the area.
Place was awesome, we came here for dinner on a weeknight so it wasn't crowded at all. We got to meet the owner and he was a super cool guy just doing what he loves. The chicken strips were awesome and the Mac n' cheese was BOMBBB. The sauces were perfect and there's nothing I could complain about this place. It's a small local spot so this place is perfect and will be back again.
The best chicken fingers! Every time I go in that place it's crowded. Great service and amazing food. Don't even think of getting any side other than the mac n cheese. You'll regret it! I've sent so many people there, and they all love the place! Can we get one on the southwest side
BFG-BFG-BFG!

Baked / Fried / Grilled... your choice for the perfect chicken fingers is located right here at BFG chicken Strips...

Located in a small outskirt strip mall under the bright lights of Sin City, here lies a delicious little chicken finger heaven!

It's got little something for everyone!  You want to go unhealthy yet deliciously crunchy, go with the fried version... want it little healthier?  Go with either the baked or the grilled version!  

Complementary partner?  The perfect mac and cheese!

Lots of sauces to choose from!  Favorite was the wasabi cream!  

I believe they also sell Korean dishes too as a special!

Service is super nice!  Word around is that this place is the hit!  And guess what?  IT IS!

So when you get the opportunity to visit LV... be sure to take a moment and try this little chicken finger joint out!  You won't be disappointed!
Did I really just drive 13 miles for some chicken strips? Sho nuff. This easily bumped the other contender in town off my list for favorite chicken fingers (sorry Cane's). If it's baked, fried or grilled you're looking for, they have it here. I had to go with fried, as I wasn't on my eternal diet at the time, I can't tell if they use panko or what but whatever it is, it's delicious. Tried the wasabi cream to dip it in and mac & cheese for my side, this was an all around comfort food win.
Great local place!! Check it out
The price is right and they are always super friendly.  My family loves both the baked and grilled. I love the sweet chili sauce and wasabi cream.  It's a small little place and there's a little bit of a longer wait for the grilled strips, but definitely worth it.
I don't get all the great reviews?  
Pros:  Grilled veggies, inexpensive, friendly staff
Cons: Long waits, lack of choices for drinks, chicken is not great.
Great place for some amazing food! The customer service is amazing, Matthew the owner is absolutely great. He takes care of us everytime we come in. The food is fresh, inexpensive, and the portion is just right.Highly recommended!
There's new ownership, but the menu hasn't changed!

Chicken: 2 pieces or 4. Baked, Fried, or Grilled. I always go baked or grilled, but I hear the fried is good, too, if you like that.

Sides: French fries, grilled veggies, or mac and cheese. Or as we call it: CRACK and cheese! It's delicious, and it's my diet-killer! I *should* eat the veggies, but I always end up with the yummy baked mac n cheese.

All that for under $7.

Under new ownership, they have something new: REAL SUGAR SODAS! Yes! They're a little more expensive, but soooo worth it! And they still have the soda fountain and excellent iced tea options as well.
I see this place has a following and I don't know if I'm one of the many. Unless there's a separate group just for the creamy wasabi sauce, then yes. I'm in. 

The place is cute and little and the boys that were working there when my family and I stopped by were SUUUPER friendly and helped us out a lot since we told them that it was our first time coming in.

I ordered the grilled chicken strips and my bf and baby got the crispy ones. The grilled chicken was delicious, I liked the panko breaded crispy ones and we ordered a bunch of sauces but none of them stood out like the creamy wasabi did. I honestly just want to go there and order a tub of that stuff so I can slather it on whatever I eat at home and other restaurants. Their grilled vegetables still had a lot of crisp to them (which I appreciate) and their french fries were......I can't remember. They're french fries. They were hot, crispy, and they had carbs.

I liked that the macaroni and cheese has a crusty top, but when I ate a spoonful of it, it really didn't blow me away. I mean it's faaaaaaar from being the disgusting kraft mac and cheese with the gross cheese powder, but I feel like the Velveeta Shells Mac N' Cheese is better.

Although they were pretty tasty, I didn't really leave the place excitingly planning out my next visit. It was sort of "meh" to me. Don't get me wrong, the place is great, friendly staff, and food is pretty good........buuuuut it just lacked something I just can't put my finger on.
I've seen pictures of my friends posting the food from here on Instagram and the looked amazing. I decided to try it out and I immediately became a fan. The staff is very nice and as a first timer, they were helpful with my order. I got the 6 grilled chicken strips with a side of Mac' n Cheese with Wasabi Cream and Sweet Chili sauce and they were delicious. The chicken was very fresh and hot right off the grill, the Mac n' Cheese was just AMAZING, very cheesey and flavorful. The wasabi sauce tasted just like wasabi (not as strong) when I was expecting some fake wasabi and they're just calling it that; but no, it was delicious. it was very  It's not too expensive, not overrated, and not too hyped like Raisin' Canes. I was very pleased with my experience here and I will definitely be visiting again.
Finally got to try this place with the kids,  wasn't terribly impressed Mac n Cheese was better than KFC and the panko breaded strips need a Lil salt n pepper.  Will be back for the the Mac though!
Love this place! Simple menu and delicious food. Wish there were more sauce choices (yes, there are quite a few already), maybe a Southwest Ranch or something. But, regardless, it's still all good!
I used to go to BFG often with some friends after school. It was nice! The staff was cool, the strips were awesome and that mac and cheese! Yum!

After they changed management, it didn't seem as... fun? 

I ordered my usual: 4 Grilled strips, Mac and Cheese, 2 pieces of bread (you can exchange one sauce for that) and Wassabi Cream. The cashier wasn't very welcoming and the counter felt cluttered with their BUY MY EXTRA DRINKS thing... Like, they sell other drinks in bottles and such. Yeah, I like the iced tea machine they have. That's nice. 
Sad to say, the chicken was dry, the food wasn't taken to us (I was spoiled before. Oops. :L) and the bread shrunk! 

It was alright. I still enjoy going here every so and so. I like their food. Their mac and cheese is awesome. Wassabi cream is awesome sauce. The wall is also awesome. It's so cute. :3
Real tiny spot with real big value for your buck.  Great food matched by great service.  We had the grilled chicken strips and the fried chicken strips.  Both were very tender and tasty, I couldn't decide which I liked better.
Why has it taking me SO long too get me some BFG? Thankfully I cam say finally got me some. Sure so many reviews not sure much more could add but think every great establishment can always use another great review! It all starts with the customer service and the personnel touch both co owners show from the minute you walk into BFG. It was my first visit so looking at the menu little confusing but he did awesome job of explaining everything too me. Very clear, friendly, and understanding manner. Each step you get choice way chicken cooked, different sauces (thinking just get one; my surprise get two choices!!!), and the sides. Not just one option but few options on the sauces and sides. If get the combo comes with garlic bread. I needed too add honesty earlier because I was looking too try as much things being my first time. He told me comes with the garlic bread since going too order one on the side. Little things or sense of personnel touch gets lost in restaurants. They have stamp card too. Woot! Woot! More reason too keep coming back for more.

The chicken strips LOVE the breading anything with panko winnah. It such cleaner breading for any protein, just lighter and crisper breading outside. The meat is perfectly cooked, moist, and juicy on the inside. The sauces Wow so many too choose from need too got back try more. I had the honey mustard and the BFG. I fan of both. The sides looking at other customers going fries but it looked too good pass up. I was not disappointed. You would think fast food type of chain thinking mac and cheese. Not sure. The mac and cheese was da bomb. It was rich with the cheddar flavor, creamy, the pasta cooked al dente, and the cheese melted top it off was just perfect topping. All this for under ten dollar if that not steal of deal not sure what else there is in life. 

I went for lunch talk about packed. I had too wait too get place too sit down. It soooo worth the wait. They have couple tables on the outside too. I really like the artwork on the side once you walk in. It has personality of its own cartoonist style but on point too the theme of the restaurant. If never been too BFG or enjoy fried chicken strip must stop in Vegas.
So I have to eat healthy says my doctor & my high blood pressure. So I was told thru the great vine that BFG cooks up good chicken. God I hate rumors and this is a perfect example as to why I cant stand a bunch of she said he said they said we said. Looks can be deceiving this is a very true statement. Anyway once in side the BFG it was packed so I felt good that this was a good decision to come here. 
I'm thinking its so packed in here this is going to be so good. Boy was I wrong. So we order food yes the husband was with me.
 Chicken mac & cheese ( Please see my pictures) along with other items. I have to tell you guys this was nothing but a mind game. I am still asking myself how can the line be outside if the food does not taste like anything. Its flavor less. It taste like it came from a common school cafeteria ewww!
It took me back to elementary, middle school & high school. I looked at my husband and said I should have packed my own lunch. lol On my way out I saw a sticker from YELP by the front door I wondered if I was being punked and I also wondered if Ashton Kutcher would jump out from behind a car with a camera crew. Some one fooled YELP this food gets a big fat zero I wish I could take the one star back. They get a negative zero. I'm still at a lost for words on how they got the yelp sticker on the door. (MAYBE IT'S NOT REAL)
Finaaaallly got to czech this place out and for once the hype is true.

Tucked away next to Home Depot, this small mom n pop restaurant serves up some great fingers and sides with their own twist on the dipping sauces. You pick from 1 of 3 kinds of fingers - baked, fried or grilled (hence the name BFG and yea I just figured that out). The food is resonably prices and for $7 I was impressed at the amount and quality of the food I got.

The side of choice seems to be baked mac and cheese which along any cheese-lover's dream come true. Custom made dipping sauces do not disappoint. The wasabi cream, and the BFG add a great kick of flavor to any panko crusted finger. The staff is super friendly, as first timers they were able to walk us through the menu and had their own recommendations. This spot is defitnely worth checking out if you're in the area.

Oh and the giant chicken mural inside is AWESOME!
If chicken's could strip, they would be found at BFG's.  Their chicken is pure sexy deliciousness. I usually don't like white meat because it gets dry so quickly, but the guys at BFG do it right. Tender, juicy, and moist. You can even be fancy and choose 2 different sauces! Say what? yup. Give their sides a try. The veggies are yummy, and the baked mac and cheese will make you take your clothes off. Ok, not really, but you get the point.
The food was really good. It's close to my house. They support our local high school. So much going for the place, but best of all: best customer service I've seen in a long time! Love this place!!
So friendly!! :)

This place is perfection! The menu is simple, the prices are on point and everything was delicious. I only wish there were more locations!
This place is awesome...It is located next to The Home Depot on Rainbow bet. Alta and Charleston.  By far the best chicken strips around.  Raising Cane..bah bye...BFG blows you away.  Not only are the chicken strips perfect (any way you order them...baked, fried or grilled) but they have the best mac and cheese and a ridiculous choice of dipping sauces...the two signature sauces are BFG and the wasabi cream (my fav)...this stuff has to bottled it is so good.  My husband and I just went back tonight after about a month or two and found out that "The Hot Chick" is  back on the menu...permanently.  This is a must have...presented like a hot dog (hence the name)...but sooo much better.  Do yourself a big favor...run don't walk to this place...you will not be disappointed...not with the food...not on the customer service...all top notch all the way.
BFG is OMG so effing good! the service is so good I think they are on something. lol. wonderful people who care so much so that I think they are the owners of the place. yes, all of them are the owners. Anyways, you get my point. I love going to BFG and sometimes I even take the family meal with me (Even though I'm single and live alone) I eat BFG for 2-3 days. the mac and cheese is to die for! my favorite chicken strips is fried though. second place is baked and third is grilled.
All in all I highly recommend it. 
if Raising Canes need to worry about competition from anyone, its BFG Chicken Strips.
Not really sure why all the great reviews. I got the Fried strips. They were just ok. Without any sauce they are really flavorless. Much prefer Raising Canes. Had the famous Mac N Cheese...again just ok, no flavor. The BFG sauce was pretty decent. Would possibly go back if in the neighborhood and need some grub, but wouldn't go out of my way for it.
I feel a little guilty giving only four stars as the employees were extremely helpful and friendly. If I owned a business, I'd want my employees to be just like those that helped me at BFG.

We drove here from the Strip because of all the good reviews (and my son loves chicken strips).

The food was good. Four star good. Even considering that is a a good value, I can't give it five stars
OMG Yumm. If I keep eating here BFG is going to stand for Big Fat Girl. I've been here at least once  a week since discovering the place. I always get the fried strips which have a light and crispy breading that can't be beat. The chicken is juicy and fresh. The Mac And Cheese is the best I've had- Soooo cheesy and always warm. The garlic bread is a lovely addition and the BFG sauce is sooooo yummy and perfect with the fried strips. Prices for combos are really reasonable and always include a drink. The service has never been anything less than stellar- they are always sweet to my son and have a frequent visitors card. 
All in all, I LOVE this place and will continue to make the trip to the neighborhood to indulge. It's converted me, and I used to be a die hard Canes fan.TRY IT!
Great chicken strips.  My wife and I ordered the panko crusted fried and the grilled chicken strips, with Mac and cheese, garlic bread and dipping sauces. 

The chicken strips were very juicy and had a lot of flavor.  Especially the grilled ones. You're always skeptical about ordering grilled chicken because it's usually dry, these were far from it. 

The Mac and cheese was also delicious.  Very cheesy and a great crust of cheese on top.  Could have used a little more salt though.  Garlic bread could have just been left out.  Nothing special there.  

Dipping sauces were the best part of the meal.  The wasabi cream was the best.  The sweet chili dipping sauce and the honey mustard had great flavor.  The BFG sauce was just a plain old fry sauce with a little extra acid. 

Overall a great meal.  We will be back.
I just dropped by here again this evening.  This place is always wonderful.  I live on the east side and make the drive all the way across town to enjoy this place!  I've never tried the fried strips, but the grilled and baked strips are both juicy and flavorful with their respected marinades.  The Mac & Cheese was on point, as usual; browned top layer of mozzarella covering a generous portion of creamy, cheesy macaroni.  The garlic toast is just so-so, but a thoughtful addition to the meal. I've tried most of the sauces, and I have to say that the Wasabi Cream is by far the best.  The Teriyaki is also a good compliment.  I plan to try the honey-mustard on my next visit!  I want to try the grilled veggies also... They look incredible, but I can never bring myself to part with the Mac & Cheese!
My wife and I love this place! Went for the first time yesterday. I got fried strips, she got  baked, and we added a grilled strip or a dollar extra. I swear you can't go wrong! All were equally tasty. Our favorite sauces were wasabi creme, and sweet chili. The mac and cheese is the mac and cheese of my dreams! They also offer vegetables and fries as sides. The service was helpful and friendly which is good because my wife always has a lot of questions at new places. Can't wait to go again!
My favorite place in town! The friendliest staff out there and by far the greatest chicken and Mac n Cheese in the world. I love The Thia Tea  and well Everything else about this place. It is the only place I have ever been considered a "Regular" in Las Vegas. If you haven't tried BFG yet you're totally missing out.
Probably the best decision I made a few weekends ago in Vegas.

I had BFG bookmarked and was determined to get off the strip and stop in.  On a Saturday night I did just that. I was NOT disappointed in so many ways.

The place gets judged by its outter appearance and even from what you can see through the window but that didn't detour me.  I seen the rating and did no care.

I walked in with my mom and the employees were so nice!  One young male and one young female.  The female who was at the counter was so informative.  Not once was she rude, she was patient, and answered all our questions.  I wanted to try different types of strips but since the 4 piece meal didn't allow it she told me to get the kid's meal with 2 strips, a side, and then order 2 more strips on the side for about the same price.  I ordered 2 fried strips, 2 baked, mac & cheese, and grilled veggies.  She gave me regular size cup instead of kids size which was really nice of her.

Man o man, the ride back to the hotel was torture!  The food smelled soooooo good! I pretty much ran off the elevator to the room.  I dived right in and did not regret one bite.  Everything was so bomb.  Fried, baked, mac & cheese, veggies, dipping sauces.

I had the healthy and sinful side of this place and cannot wait to go back.
As good as it gets, pretty much sums it up. The chicken is perfect, sauces are great...wasabi cream is crazy good. Personal size Mac n cheese is fantastic...highly recommended
6 months later and BFG is still doing it right ;)
So BFG was created and owned by Jin and Tin who has now sold it to someone. Now, whenever ownership changes there is always a worry if it is for better or worse of the food and service. When a place that had a frontman bursting with personality that built a rapport with people, it's admittedly hard to not miss that. 

I am however pleased that the food is just as good, tastes the same. I got my favorite like always - the perfectly crisp fried strips, grilled veggie skewers or fries, honey mustard and wasabi. 

I like that the weekly specials like the hot chick and the nachos are just on the permanent menu instead of a weekly rotating special. No teriyaki bowl or bibimbap that I noticed being still on the menu. Sucks, teriyaki bowls here are great with the strips and I used to always order that. 

Service is efficient. They're friendly and smiley enough, but I guess things will never be the same if people aren't as personable. I know, I know. I sound like I'm whining over something trivial... 

Still, if you want some good basic comfort food chicken strips, this is where I go and you should too.
Good, fast & inexpensive. Definitely better than raising canes. I used to come here during my breaks from school since its so close. It gets busy during school hours but I've never waited longer than 10 mins. Great place to grab a quick bite to eat!
Finally, I received some tender loving! I have been wanting to come to BFG for the longest time. For those of you who aren't hip enough to know what BFG stands for, it means Baked, Fried or Grilled. You have the choice of choosing either of those three options. Upon walking in, I noticed that this placed had to be good because it was packed the whole time I was there. I ordered the 6 finger meal, which comes garlic bread, your choice of side (macaroni and cheese, fries or grilled veggies) and your choice of three sauces, too many to name right now. I got fried chicken tenders, mac n cheese and my sauces were ranch, BFG and the yasabi sauce.

The wait for the meal was not long at all, before I even expected it I was already greeted with a tray of my delicious foods. It's kind of hard to ruin chicken tenders, but there was something about these tenders that blew me away. They were delicious and cooked to perfection. The panko breading was a perfect compliment to the succulent chicken that was surprisingly juicy. Although I got fried, I will go back and try those baked tenders because I looked at a strangers plate and they looked freaking delicious. I got 6 tenders and I could only eat 4 of them, they are sized just right and not too small or too large.

I was super excited to try the macaroni and cheese and that was, admittedly, the first thing that I ended up trying. The M&C was baked in this generous tin and my gosh. Something so simple tasted so great. It had this layer of cheese baked right on top and I didn't want it to end, but my stomach did and I got super full really quick. But it was amazing.

The sauces were great, ranch was ranch. The BFG sauce tasted something like Thousand Island but I LOVED the Yasabi sauce. It wasn't spicy or anything, but it just tasted great. I loved it and kind of gave it all my love with my tenders. 

I'd recommend this place to anyone and I'm glad I was able to visit one of my Yelp bookmarks after numerous failed attempts to go. If you go, let me know cause I am down!
Good food and great service. The chicken and the baked mac and cheese was really good.   The mac and cheese was creamy and had a nice crisp cheese melted on top.   I like the variety of sauces they had to offer.   The guy working the counter Matt, was very nice and helpful.
Chicken done right...the panko breading is really good and the baked Mac & Cheese?!!?!! And did I say "the price is right?!?  Definitely a good alternative to fast food!
I was searching for new places to try out; I came across BFG. I ordered the panko covered fried chicken strips and mac & cheese. The chicken strips were tasty but I had to wait a little bit so it wouldn't burn my mouth. The mac & cheese was good and creamy. The staff were friendly.
I think I am in love!!!

After hearing about BFG Chicken Strips for months through the grapevine, I was finally able to get over there today and check this joint out.  And boy was I a happy camper once I got my delicious lunch!

As the name states, you can get chicken strips baked, fried, or grilled.  I went for fried because is there really a choice when fried is an option?  So I ordered the 4 piece combo and went for the mac n' cheese as a side.  I was with my mom who ordered the same except went for the fries, so I got to sample both.  

The mac n' cheese, as stated in so many other reviews, is simply amazing!  It was cheesy heaven with a bit of pasta thrown in to make it easier to eat.  Yummy!  The fries were right on as well.  Great crispy fries without being too crunchy.  They also have grilled veggies, but if it's healthy, I never get it, so I can't comment on that side option.

A great addition to the food were the numerous dipping sauce choices.  I love dipping stuff into other stuff. The more dipping options I have, the better!  I heart condiments.  With that being said, BFG has 9 sauces to pick from to dip your delicious chicken into.  We went with the BFG, BBQ, Honey Mustard, and Ranch sauces.  All were good but I do have to say the BFG sauce really complimented the chicken nicely.  As for the Honey Mustard, they must put crack in it, because I am addicted.  I don't even need to dip anything in it because I think I would drink it, if I could.  I'm a classy chick, can't you tell?

So yes, BFG Chicken Strips is a great hole in the wall place.  If you are in the area or love good chicken fingers, go check them out.
Wow this place definitely caught me by surprise... by how good it was.  We drove wayyyy west to try this chicken strip place on a Sunday afternoon for some late lunch.  The restaurant is in a strip mall near Home Depot and it can be easily missed.  Just drive along all the stores until you hit a square chicken head on a blue awning.

The menu is pretty simple:

1.  First you choose your combo, 2 pieces, 4 pieces,  or 6 pieces.  If you have 3 or more people the party platter of 20 seems like a good deal.  

2.  Then you choose your type of chicken.  BFG baked, fried, or grilled.  The baked chicken was my fave, tender and moist.  The fried had a delicious panko crust.  The grilled seemed like the healthiest of the bunch.  

3.  Next you choose your sauces.  This is when it gets fun.  The teriyaki goes well with the grilled.  The wasabi cream is unique sauce that is pretty popular.  My fave sauces have to be the regular BBQ and Ranch.  I love double dipping into those two and making it a mixture.  

4.  Get a side.  Grilled veggies, baked macaroni and cheese, or fries.  The veggies were well seasoned and the baked mac and cheese was super cute in a baby pie tin haha.  

5.  Last get your drink.  

Very reasonably priced for good quality chicken strips.  The customer service here is great too!  The sauces definitely make the meal.  An awesome place to pick up some appetizers for a party.  I would definitely consider a party platter next time I have to bring something over to someone's house.

P.S. You can add any type of chicken strip to your combo for $1 each.
Great food!

All you need!

Flavorful sauces and delicious mac & cheese!
Read the reviews and tried it first in February, 2013. The food and service were terrific.  The value it incredible.  We like to go to local restaurants while on vacation. Came back August 17, 2013, this place is fantastic!  Tender, moist chicken strips with all but two sauces homemade.  Try the teriyaki sauce with wasabi.  The couple next to our table, from Seattle, they also found the restaurant on yelp,  but researched 'Best Mac & Cheese in Vegas'. The Mac n' Cheese is the best I have ever had,  individually made and baked to perfection.  Mat delivered each order making sure customer was completely satisfied.  Rarely do you receive this high level of customer service anymore.  Will come back every time I am in town.  The name is changing to Strip n' Dip due to name duplication with a fish restaurant in another town.  Doesn't matter what the name is, you will call it delicious.
Food is pretty darn good, but the service is IMPECABLE!  Super-friendly, out of their way courteous.  What a joy!!

We tried all three types of strips, Baked, Fried, and Grilled.  All were yummy, and the Mac is D-Lish!  Family friendly.  We'll def be going back again!
Great friendly staff! It was our first time in here. Saw an article about this place in Las Vegas weekly a while back and have wanted to check it out since. I got the baked fingers and my son had the fried fingers. Both were very good (ya I stole a bite or two. Had to try it to review it right). We both got Mac n cheese as highly recommended by every other review and the staff. It was great!!! My picky eater even agreed! I was a little bummed they don't make their own ranch since they make almost every other sauce, I hate bottled ranch so I didn't even try. The cheese sauce is great for fries and I enjoyed the buffalo for my baked fingers. We will be back!
Quaint little place on Rainbow Plaza for some bomb chicken strips & Mac n Cheese? Count me in! 

Name has changed from BFG to Strip n Dip Chicken Strips, I'm assuming from change of owner? BFG logo is still on the big banner above the front door when I visited so just spot for that when you're looking for the place.

Onto the food: Delish! Ordered the Fried, Fries w/ Teri Sauce & Strip Sauce while the boyfriend opted for Baked, Mac n Cheese w/ Wasabi Cream & Sweet Chili. 

Chicken was moist & tender. Can't go wrong with panko breading either! Fries were crispy not soggy just how I like it. Pretty good portion for the Mac n Cheese too. Considering you have garlic bread to devour as well. 

The sauces were all so good, it was like a game which one I'd dip into. As everyone here says, wasabi cream was the best. Immediate wasabi flavor but dissipates afterwards which I appreciate so it's not too overwhelming.

All in all, great experience! Can't wait to go back and try the other sauces! Lol
food is amazing and the service is even better!  Definitely my new favorite close to home place.
great service and very cool dudes working there. we need a location out here in socal. best chicken strips ive ever had, with panko breading. wasabi cream sauce compliments perfectly. and that baked mac, im pretty sure i ingested some of the tin the baked mac is served in, just trying to get every morsel left of the cheesy crust. fried chicken strips were moist and tender and cooked perfectly.
Was in Las Vegas on business and need a place close to the office to pick up a quick bite to eat.  Happened upon this place due to the reviews I saw on here and decided to give it a shot.

I'm glad I did!  I ordered the 4 piece strip meal, fried, along with the baked mac 'n cheese.  I'd like to consider myself somewhat of a mac 'n cheese expert, one of my favorite sides, and this macaroni was full of cheesy goodness.  Absolutely devoured it!  The strips were nicely breaded and fried to a nice golden crunch and both the dipping sauces I received, buffalo and honey mustard were quite good as well.  

I wouldn't hesitate to come back and try some more when I'm back in town!
My love for chicken only heightened eating here..Amazing, you have a choice of grilled, baked or fried chicken strips. the Mac n' cheese is a must try ! And also chicken nachos. Although the place is a bit small the service from the employees & food make up for it.
Chicken strips, chicken sandwich... something chicken was what my husband and I were hankering for yesterday for lunch. Drive to St. George for Chik-Fil-A? Nah. Cane's? Hmm. Ah, so I consulted Yelp and up came Strip N Dip. I remember bookmarking this one awhile ago as BFG Chicken Strips. Apparently the restaurant has gone through some changes since then, and it had a stint where it was closed, but - it is back open and man, is it good.

The location is a little odd, tucked into a shopping center sandwiched between Albertsons and Home Depot. It is small, few tables and a bar, with a few tables for outdoor seating. But the inside is cool with vibrant posters and a digital menu reader board. 

My husband and I both opted for the fried 4-strip meal with the baked mac and cheese. The mac and cheese reminded me of a little personal pizza sitting in my basket. When I dug in its ooey-gooeyness and delicious cheesiness was sublime! I think more people should put cheese over macaroni like they do. 

As for the strips - absolutely perfectly done. Juicy and tender on the inside yet fried to a crispy, but not hard outside. The panko breading I really enjoyed, my husband said he would have rather had a normal batter-like outside like Cane's does. *shrugs* Dipping sauces - I went with the Strip Sauce, of course, had to try that one and it is very good and addicting. And I opted for the buffalo because I wanted a bit of heat. Both good, but next time I'm definitely going for that wasabi one. 

The service was SO NICE! These guys are really trying hard to make customers feel very welcome. You could even say it is a familial vibe here.

If you like Cane's, you must try Strip N Dip. Just for an alternative because they are really doing chicken strips right.
Color me impressed.  I decided to go to this place after much self-debate on what to eat, and I am really REALLY glad I went here.

$4.95 gets you a kids' meal - 2 strips, 1 side, 1 sauce and a  16oz drink.  That's awesome, and is also the perfect size for me.  Of course they have larger, too!

The BFG sauce is what I tried and I definitely liked it a lot with their tender, well-coated fried chicken fingers.  Downright delicious.

For my side, I chose the baked macaroni and cheese... it is so creamy and southern that it filled a hole I didn't even know I had from leaving Texas.

While the food is great, the customer service is on the same par.  Interactive, friendly, helpful but not to the point of invading your space.  They make it a point to remember your name and go above and  beyond.  Being in fanatical customer service myself, this gets crazy points in my book!

For a future work lunch, I will probably try and convince them to cater from this place.  Yum!
Amazingly good chicken strips and phenomenal mac and cheese.  

We met up with some friends here and were able to cobble together a table for 7 but otherwise, the restaurant is pretty small (and casual).  

I decided to be healthier and get the grilled chicken strips while hubby went all out with the deep fried ones.  I have to admit, though mine were good (maybe a touch on the salty side given that you get sauces), hubby's were so fantastic, even without sauce!  Our favorite sauces were honey mustard and the spicy Asian sauce, combined with some good 'ole fashioned sriracha.  

Who would have known chicken strips could be so wonderful?  The mac and cheese didn't hurt either - I can't remember the last time I finished and liked an entire serving of m&c.

Service was great and I love the name - somehow Vegas appropriate lol.
The chicken nachos are great!! Finely chopped chicken loaded with cheese, sour cream, and pico. Yum!! The Thai Iced Coffee was delicious. Very reasonably priced place for good quality food.
Visiting the other neck of the woods I was in the mood for a healthy alternative to traditional fast food. I'm not a fast foodie by any means but dinner time ran late and this girl wasn't in the mood to cook. 

Protein on the go! Strip N Dip offers healthy alternatives to the traditional (and most often) delicious deep friend chicken strips.  I ordered the baked AND grilled chicken strips (had to quality control them both), and I was pleasantly surprised by their flavor minus the delicious sauce options.  

A diverse selection of sauce options, veggies or carb-filled sides (mac & cheese, fries..) and garlic bread come with every order.

For the price and the food quality it's a nice alternative to traditional fast food.

The venue itself is filled with sass and the staff was nothing short of what customer service SHOULD be in this town.
This place is legit. Chicken is good, garlic is good and Mac and cheese is good. Only advice, eat slowly so you don't burn yourself like I did. Also, I hope they can give two garlic bread instead of one since portion is too small!
Really good chicken strips and darn good macaroni and cheese. Thanks to the really friendly staff for the suggestion of the Wasabi Cream dip. It is awesome and made me a big fan of this place. They offer the strips grilled, baked or fried, can't go wrong with any of them. All of the dipping sauces are great but try the Wasabi Cream.
The best chicken and mac&cheese in town, hands down. I ordered the grilled chicken with Mac and cheese while my hubby ordered the chicken nachos. The chicken was so tender and juicy. I'm not a macaroni and cheese person, but this one is so tasty. The chicken nachos was so tasty as well, it was absolutely made to perfection! I don't mind driving across town to eat their food. It is that good!
What a gem this place is! I wish there was a location in the southwest side of town, because I would go there everyday. I like to compare this place to In-N-out..... not that it is the same type of food, but it is similar in simplicity! They only have a few items on their menu (like in-n-out). It's just genius. I hate going to places that have a billion items on their menu and it takes me forever to look over everything and then the food is blah. This chicken strip place is awesome! 

Get your chicken strips either Baked, Fried, or Grilled! Simple as that! 
And the fried strips are coated in panko crumbs, which makes it taste better then regular battered fried chicken. 

Their frys are as expected.....BUT the baked Mac-N-Cheese is what makes it.
It comes in a round tin container, which doesn't seem like a lot, but it is plenty. It has this layer of cheese on top that is slightly burnt, not the gross burnt, but that slight cheese burnt. If you are a cheese lover, there is no denying this place's Mac-N-Cheese! 

It is also family owned which I love to support in this town! 

Lastly, their prices are reasonable, on the cheaper side. Its great that this place is in business. I hope they do well and open up more locations!
Simply amazing. The chicken is delicious fried, baked or grilled all very different and all taste amazing. Baked mac and cheese wow very good cooked to order fresh and hot. They make their own sauces and I must say another star I don't usually like honey mustard And I would come back here just for honey mustard lol but true it had the right amount of all ingredients. Staff is super friendly and welcoming and the environment is welcoming and very clean. Pricing is very affordable I would pay double food is so good. Thank you staff and management my family and I very much enjoyed our meals.
We bought the family deal, which was huge!  What an awesome deal, we were eating chicken strips for two days after.  Chicken is decent quality and sauces are tasty. Thumbs up overall!
Not Bad At All

Order:
4 piece fried combo, w/ fries, cheese & buffalo sauce
4 piece baked combo, grilled veggies, wasabi cream & sweet chili sauce

Fried strips were very crunchy !!!!  Baked strips were tender & juicy.
Grilled veggies were good, but a little heavy on the onions. Fries were crispy. All 4 sauces were good. 

My favorite sauce was the wasabi cream.
Amazingly good chicken strips and phenomenal mac and cheese.
Me encanta el pollo era suave, jugoso, delicioso y que decir del Mac and Cheese.
If I could give more stars I would! This spot has my two favorite things: Mac n cheese and fried chicken!! I love the way the menu is set up, very easy to understand and easy to order. You can't go wrong with anything, everything is fresh cooked to order and the signature sauce is on point! I love how the location is not super big, the food comes out fast and the owner Matt is such a sweetheart. Def have to stop by again next time I'm in Vegas!
This is why I love Yelp. I had never heard of this place before and, considering it's proximity to my house, I'm not sure if I would've ever just stumbled across it on my own. But after reading some promising reviews and looking at some of the pictures, I knew I had to give it a shot. I'm so glad I did. It's pretty standard fare, but it's done really, really well. You can get the chicken fingers baked, grilled or fried, which is a nice way to mix it up and keep it fresh on future visits. We had the fried fingers, which are breaded in panko, and they were great. I love panko breading, but it tends to tear the inside of my mouth up. Obviously that's not their fault. I was just making note. Beyond that, like Raising Cane's (and other chicken finger joints), you get a side, sauce and a piece of toast. The toast, was okay, but nothing compared to Raising Cane's. I mean, not even in the same galaxy. However, they give you your choice of 2 sauces (unlike RC's). We had the standard (peach-colored, mayo-based) and it was quite good, the honey mustard and it was really good, and the buffalo and, let me tell you, it was absolutely delicious! I can't wait to try the others. All of that being said, I would probably give this place 4 stars. That is, of course, if I was to ignore their macaroni and cheese. That was easily the high point of both of our meals. It was perfect! Creamy and cheesy and rich and oven-browned on top, this, my friends, is the real reason to eat here! I could probably write another paragraph on the virtues of it's cheesy, delectable glory, but I will spare you. Hell, I couldn't do it justice anyway.
The last thing I would like to mention is how friendly the lady who took our order was. She was smiling and friendly and helpful and personable...and I'm a little embarrassed that I can't remember her name...especially after she remembered my wife's while checking on us. Sorry about that. Regardless, I am very, very happy that we found this place and I highly recommend it to everyone. 
(oh yeah. 1 more thing. it's small, REAL small inside. so be prepared to take your order to-go)
All I can say is you can have your chicken bake, fried or grilled! And every way is the best to have... I was visiting with my family from out of town and stumbled to this place. I wanted to come again the next day but we had a flight out. Recommend this place to everyone for clean, great tasting and affordable food. The manager Matthew took care of us and he was excited about his new coke machine they installed. Go check it out!
They put in a fancy soda dispenser and, in order to compensate for the new expense (along with "rising food costs"), have dropped the drinks from being included in their meals. I only got the Gold Peak tea to begin with, so the machine doesn't do anything for me. They also raised the prices of the meals to add insult to injury. I removed one star for removing drinks from the meals and one star for raising the prices while simultaneously giving less. 

Probably won't be a regular here any longer. The days of BFG are over. Just doesn't seem worth it to support this place anymore. The kid at the counter is still really great with customer service though. He's always friendly and attentive. Just don't like the direction this company is headed in. There are plenty of other places to get my chicken fix.
Great chicken. Great sauces. Even better service!!! If you dont stop here, you dont like the finer things in life.
Ima keep it real: this place was average. I got 6 baked strips and the Mac n cheese. I feel like anyone who puts time and a little effort into making their own would be much more satisfied. The owner was there and kept asking how it was and we were polite. Place is clean and cool decor. Just don't go in and expect to have overly great strips, sauces and sides. After eating there I wanted to go to Raisin Canes to do it right.
Never having the original BFG, I finally got down to the new Strip N Dip to enjoy some high quality fast food!  This little place apparently remodeled, and the inside is very hip.  They have a fancy digital coke machine, and big trendy posters on the wall.  It feels like a restaurant down on the Strip.  If you have trouble finding it, it is next door to Home Depot, to the south.  

I ordered the baked chicken strips, with the mac n cheese, and chose the wasabi and strip dip as my two dips, all under $8.  The chicken was juicy and tender, very good!  The mac n cheese was awesome, perfectly caramelized on top and not overly rich in the cheese department.  The sauces were bang on as well, especially the wasabi.  It was lightly sweet, but still gave that classic wasabi nostril burn! 

I am definitely coming back, especially considering it is pretty close to my house.  I want to try the fried chicken strips, but at the same time this is a good healthier alternative to my Raising Canes addiction.  I also met one of the new owners, a young man named Matt.  He was very friendly and obviously cares a lot about the quality of his establishment and getting the word out.  If you haven't tried Strip N Dip, give them a shot!
I went here with extended family (about 14 people).  They were very accommodating. The guy behind the counter rearranged some tables so we could all sit together.  
As far as fast food goes the food was really good.
I skipped the gym so I can eat some deep-fried chicken and since I was in the area, I decided to give Strip N Dip a try. I never went here when it was still BFG so I will not be one of those people who would complain about the dang mural of chickens on the wall. "This place would've been 5 stars if they hadn't painted over the mural"...seriously? Did that mural make your food taste better?

I was impressed by the super friendly service. I was surprised a chicken place had Thai tea so of course, I got that since I love Thai tea and it was pretty good. Since it was my first time, I wanted to try as many items as I can.  I went with the 6-pc combo with 1 side, garlic bread and 3 dips and added another side.

Chicken:
You choose from baked (with rotisserie seasoning), fried (breaded in panko) or grilled (marinated in Asian honey glaze). I got the panko-breaded fried chicken strips. It was light and not greasy. The chicken was cooked perfectly but still juicy. 4/5

Side Dishes:
They have baked mac n cheese, French fries and grilled veggies.  I went with the mac n cheese and fries. The mac n cheese was delish with the melted mozzarella on top. The fries are crispy but you have to dip them in sauce to make them tasty - eating them sans sauce is pretty blah. 4/5

Sauces:
Your options are BBQ, buffalo, cheese, wasabi cream, honey mustard, ranch, sweet chili, strip sauce and teriyaki. I tried the wasabi cream, strip sauce and ranch. Ranch was a stupid choice since you can get ranch anywhere but that was my back-up plan in case I didn't like the other sauces. It was ranch. The strip sauce was similar to Cane's dipping sauce so I liked it. I didn't like the wasabi cream. You can taste wasabi the first few seconds and then sweetness takes over. I'm not going to get that again. I have about 4 sauces that I'm willing to try next time I go. But for having lots of options for sauces... 4/5
We had to cater an event at our office and remember that Strip N Dip did catering. Now if you been to typical catered events, they are overpriced with extremely limited selections for food. You know what I'm talking about, sandwiches with limited selections, or the pizza that someone had to order pineapples... WHY??? 

I digress. We had ordered all the different chicken strips (Baked, Fried, and Grilled) and all of them came out just like the restaurant. The Fried strips were delicious and still crispy even after 30-45 minutes. 

We got sides of Mac' N Cheese and veggies on the side and wow, I thought I was in the store. 

I highly recommend this place to cater your next event. But if you really feel like cold pineapple pizza, I guess that works too, but remember some of your guests will be griping.
I'm from good 'ol Henderson and by chance I had to work on this side of town today. Not knowing the area too well I needed to find a nice place for lunch that wasn't a typical chained place to eat.

Yelp led me here.

I ordered my food to go, 4 baked chicken strips, mac 'n cheese, 1 BBQ sauce and 1 Honey Mustard. A drink is NOT included with the meal, when places do not include drinks...I opt for the free water. Total was about $7 and some change.

I got my food to go, went to my car to eat and noticed they gave me the wrong meal. Went back inside and they realized their mistake, switched it out, and I went back to my car. I received two honey mustards with my order and no BBQ.

The food was good for what it was, but I felt like a lard ass after I ate the extra cheesy mac 'n cheese. Next time, if there is a next time, I'll opt for the veggies.

The male employee with the braces was extra nice though, I'd give him 5 stars on his customer service!
This place is addictive, so planning and extra 10 minutes in the gym everyday for the rest of your life will be required should you decide to eat here :-) 

My first experience; a business lunch was catered in at the college and we had the most amazing grilled chicken strips with several different types of dips, some grilled veggies and these little tins filled with the most creamy, cheesy Mac-n-cheese like mom used to make.  It was an excellent lunch, made us feel like kiddos again during a long day of meetings.  

2nd experience;  a month later we requested the same caterer however they were über busy and could not deliver so we decided we would go to them.  They are located about 30 minutes away, but they were that good and worth it.  This time a order the fried chicken strips with the wasabi cream and honey mustard sauces with grilled veggies.  It again was DELISH!  So much, my colleague order some extra to take with him on the plane.  

3rd experience; oh heck, I've been back more times now then I would admit to :-) yes they are that good!  

Order their fried chicken strips with the wasabi cream sauce and the Mac-n-cheese then plan to spend an extra 10-20 minutes in the gym!!!  I'm looking forward to going back the next time I'm in Vegas.  I hope to see you there.
"Woohoo! As good as it gets!" But really though, this place is awesome.
This has been on my 'to try' list for so long. I enjoyed my experience before I even tried any of the food. 
Service: The cashier was very friendly. My friend and I were very indecisive because we wanted everything. We also changed our minds a couple of times an he was patient and helpful. At first I thought it was just that one cashier, but another guy was coming around and helping us out. Now, I know they just have awesome service all around!

Sauces: Yes, the sauces get their own category. We basically got all of the sauces and took a dip in each one to make sure we got the whole experience. The winners? Wasabi Cream, honey mustard, and the chili one (I forgot the name). You must get those three! You'll regret it if you don't, trust me.

Food: We got the the grilled and baked chicken strips. I enjoyed both. I feel like with the right sauces you can't go wrong with these. 
Macaroni and cheese - it's like a pizza, but with macaroni! Can't go wrong with baked macaroni and cheese. 
Chicken nachos! YES! It's a decent size for $4.00 It goes great with the meal if you're sharing with your friends!

The point system is also a plus. I spent $11 but since I also did the survey and whatnot I ended up with 30+ points, so I guess that's pretty cool.

Basically what I'm saying with this entire review is, TRY EVERYTHING.
Heard the buzz around town about this place and being the fried chicken lover I am, I had to check it out. First off the lady taking orders was super helpful and guided the wife and I easily through the menu. We choose to get fried and baked strips. We both got the Mac n Cheese which is AMAZING!! Back to the chicken, I actually preferred the baked over the fried, the sauces save the fried chicken otherwise they're pretty bland. The baked chicken however is seasoned nicely and needs no sauce, but I did anyway. Overall I liked this place and will come back for sure.
Let's put it this way I had way better strips at KFC and that not saying much! I tried the bake and fried strips and the mac cheese! The first strip which I tired was fried stip and it was ok. Then I bite into the second and it went down hill from here, the chicken had a weird texture to it,so I move on to the bake strips which were  very bland and the say texture issue. I took a bit of the Texas toasts and it was really buttery and crispy and last the mac cheese they use cheese wiz to mix the noodles up then top it off with mozz or chedder cheese I think! The topping of the cheese is the best part!! Who uses cheese wiz for mac cheese. The only reason I'm  giving them 3 starts is for the cool ass soda machine and the cool employee who help me out!
I never met Jin. I do not believe I have ever met anyone named Jin. I am not even sure how the name Jin is pronounced (is it gin, like the libation?) 

Anyway, I become acquainted with BFG from walking by it from the CSN Las Vegas campus. (Yes, human being are still capable of walking, believe it or not.) This is where the locals go, I had heard, but I was a local and I had never heard of it (or the former owner Jin). 

In any case, they changed their name (unrelated to Jin) and subsequently included desserts to their very basic menu. It just so happened to be a dessert I yearn for on a regular -- unnaturally, regular really -- basis: funnel cake (2.25$). Score!

And their chicken is ultimately delectable. I prefer the Baked, then the Grilled, and finally the Fried. BGF. Always get the 6-piece (8.79$, as of this writing). The mac & cheese tastes so delicious, it makes me want to become a fan of mac & cheese (I am not). They have a bunch of sauces as well but I do not mess with anything besides cheddar cheese (is this the only place that has it?) and barbecue, since it is all that is truly needed in life.  

The service is so friendly, personable, and funny, they make you want to return sooner than you intended. The loyalty programme has teeth too: there is a place for your birthday and anniversary (it could be your Yelpversary if you have no partner!) online and succeeding completion of your first survey, it should be only one more visit to go before receiving your complimentary Four-Strip Meal. How cool is that? 

SDCS does not have the same roll of the tongue as BFG (Fuck Bone Grill), but there is room for some SDCC (ComicCon) parodying when it is that time of year (especially with the nerd [comic] store next door). 

Needless to say, I vociferously recommend this business. It is not like there is really much else around anyway, especially if you are walking. Look both ways at the crosswalks. - E
Great chicken, every time. And they have the coke machine of a hundred flavors...
On Dec 3, 2013, at 1 PM, I tried Strip N Dip located at 873 S Rainbow Blvd, Las Vegas. Mind you I had previously ate at Guthrie's and Cane's and were not impressed. In fact they were awful. I ordered the 8 piece combo ( fried) for myself and my friend had the 4 piece (fried). Each combo came with your choice of sides. I chose the macaroni & cheese and my friend chose the grilled vegetables in a skewer. Drink and garlic toast included. Large variety of dipping sauces to choose from. I was blown away by the service and the food. Large pieces of chicken strips cooked to perfection !! The sides were excellent too.The food was brought out to us outside where there were seating. I was also asked how everything was during the course of our meal.  BEST CHICKEN STRIPS in VEGAS !!!!!!
I came here to finally check out the new BFG but lo and behold it's now called Strip N Dip. New name, same great chicken

The premise is pretty simple. They sell chicken strips. You can get em baked, fried, or grilled. Hence the name. 
The chicken, is finger licking good. They have a wide array of sauces but the most unique one is wasabi cream. I love that and the sweet chili, but they have about 8, so you might like something different. 
The sides are where they really make their name.  The baked Mac and cheese is extremely creamy and a must try. They have chicken nachos, but I prefer to have them as chicken fries instead and mind= blown. 
For dessert, they have funnel cake, which is not common
Long story short, I'm definately gonna be coming back. Food was great, service was super friendly
We decided to this place out based on the Yelp reviews & recommendations. We approached the counter with our three daughters, who were very excited that a restaurant's main entree was chicken strips. The cashier/order-taker is by far the nicest person in Vegas, though there are lots of nice people there (he wasn't wearing a name tag). He asked us if we'd been there before (first time), thanked us for coming in & quickly explained the menu as well as offered suggestions. 
We ordered the Family Meal and per his suggestion split the chicken strips three ways: fried, grilled and baked. The meal came with four sides so we again went with his suggestion: 3 homemade, baked macaroni & 1 french frie(s). It also came with 5 sclices of garlic bread and lots of homemade sauces. There are only four tables inside but we were able to snag one and eat in.
All three "types" of strips were really good! None of them were dry. My husband really liked the wasbi cream, I think their buffalo is great. Their baked macaroni was a hit from our toddler to us parents. 
I'm a people watcher (okay, yes an eavesdropper!) and noticed that the cashier was super nice & helpful to everyone that came in. Seriously, having such awesome customer service makes patrons come back for great food or try a second time. :)
"Hey there, random Yelper that doesn't live in Las Vegas. This business is a chicken strip joint next to a Home Depot about 8 miles away from the Strip. Tell me why I should go here."

Okay, I will.

1. Let's face it; people of all ages love chicken strips. I love chicken strips. My husband loves chicken strips. If you love chicken strips, you should come here.
2. We had them baked and fried. Both styles of chicken were super juicy and flavorful, even without the sauce.
3. Oh yes, their sauces. We tried the honey mustard and sweet chili sauces. The honey mustard was a perfect balance of sweet and savory, and the sweet chili wasn't the cloyingly sweet sauce you might find elsewhere. 
4. THE MAC AND CHEESE. It's as good as everyone else says it is. I almost wanted a second tin, but decided that it was the perfect amount.
5. Service. Wow. The cashier was very friendly, asked us how we found out about them (Yelp!), checked on us every so often, and thanked us for coming all the way out there.
6. They have a freestyle Coke machine. Win!
7. The prices are very affordable for fast, yet fresh and tasty food.

So if you're in Vegas, and you have a car (or are willing to pay the cab fare), make the trip to this little place. It'll be worth it.
Comfort food served at an awesome price, convenient, friendly staff, quiet atmosphere; what more could one want?
As I said in my first review, the food is absolutely fantastic. However, I'm revising it and taking away 1 star simply due to Matt (the owner) and his over-the-top, near-creepy, downright-obnoxious attempts at "friendliness". Really, this guy is just WAY too much to handle. I expect to have to deal with the transparently-fake "used car salesman" type when I'm shopping for a car, but it's the last thing I want to deal with when I'm trying to eat dinner. I genuinely appreciate quality, friendly service (as I also said in my earlier review), but this guy's shameless, ridiculous, contrived, almost insulting "enthusiasm" is bordering on unbearable. In short, while I love their food, Matt's irritating shtick is in danger of keeping me and my wife away from this place. Reel it in, man. You're literally chasing customers away.
The owners are nice, almost a little TOO nice. The chicken is good I got the fried and baked versions and I liked the fried better. Mac and cheese I was not blown away. It was cheesy and hot but it lacked flavor! My biggest gripe is those sauce cups I mean really they are 1 oz cups and are not even full. I use 1 cup per chicken strip at least. I asked for more sauce and they are 40 cents for 1 oz of sauce. Wing stop has better wings and fries and more sauce. Their 4 oz sauce cups are 50 cents thanks
Bomb food haven't had a meal i don't like. Wasabi cream and teriyaki is so good. Great people great food great prices all reasons to eat here
I finally stopped here with my Yelp bestie Heather S. before I left town going to the land down under... I have passed by this joint a kazillion times. I had not even realized the name change until we were walking up to enter! Wow they are super friendly, and I thought the lead cashier, maybe shift leader who helped us place our order was yummy! 

I decided on the fried strips and mac and cheese, and Heather S. got the grilled chicken strips with mac and cheese.

The food is fresh and good. Really how can you go wrong with breading chicken and frying it, they do seem to make it just that much more delicious. I love the fried strips, the panko breading was fried to a perfect golden brown, mmmmm yum yes..

My only thing is that I think they should give up the sauce more. That is a pet peeve of mine when a joint charges for or limits "extra" sauce. I mean they are called strip n dip chicken right? I ordered the 6 piece chicken strip meal and ran out of sauce with there limit of 3 small dipping sauce sides.

Anyhow, it was good,  I just did not get the happy ending I had been hoping for...

This goes in my overrated file.... :(
Yes! So I finally got down here last night and tried it.  

For me, it was Okay.  I would've given 3 stars except that the service was phenomenal.  

We got here around 9:15pm at night and the place was pretty busy.  By the time we got our orders taken, however there were some free tables.

I ordered 4 grilled strips an the grilled veggies. I was disappointed that I was told that you could not mix n match grilled / baked / fried chicken. I wanted to try them all but wasn't allowed to, so I just chose the grilled.

My wife chose the 6 fried chicken strips with mac n cheese.

The sauces that we chose were: Chicken Strip Dip, Wasabi, Ranch, Teriyaki and Buffalo Sauce.  

The Teriyaki was awesome.  My second favorite was Buffalo and third was Wasabi.

I was disappointed on the extra charge for sauces that are not included in your combo meal.

My wife also wanted to try the chicken nachos.  The nachos were good, they reminded me of Taco Bell nachos with chicken instead.

I like that they got the new soft drink machine where you can choose tons of combinations.  My killer combo is Diet Coke with Cherry in it.

The food was okay, I expected the serving size to be slightly larger.  The food took a LONG time to come out.  They make it to order.  We came starving and was just about out of backbone when the food finally came out.

One thing was that the music was so loud in the restaurant that I could barely hear the guy taking my order, let alone talk to my wife.

The customer service was AWESOME!  If we were ever around this place again, I'd give it another whirl... just turn the music down a little bit.
Do not be fooled by the old pictures of the Bibimbap like I was! Those are YEARS old! They do not serve this anymore. This is just a chicken fast food joint now. Sorely disappointed. The food wasn't worth the trip at all. The place has only a few tables, was filthy, and had only 2 staffers working during the lunch rush.
Had it for the first time, and I fell in love! It's delicious and not pricey :) I'll definitely be back
I first visited this restaurant back in 2011 (as BFG) when Yelpers all over Vegas were fawning over it.   Not only was the food raved about but everyone seemed amazed at how well the owner at the time could remember names to faces and naturally I wanted to test it out.   True story: the 2nd time I went back he had no idea who I was.   Nice parlor trick!   The fact that it's extremely close to my work didn't hurt either.   As of a few weeks ago I visited it again for the 4th time (the 2nd time under the new monikor).   I feel like that fact pretty much exemplifies how I feel about about it.   If I hated it, I probably would have never returned.   If I loved it, I'd probably have been 15-20 times at least.   Yelp math!   In those 4 visits I have tried all 3 variations of their signature chicken strips, and the grilled veggies, mac and cheese, and fries for sides.   

Grilled:  This is what I was most excited about.   Every so and so months I decide that I need to stop gorging myself on red meat and carbs as I usually do, so reading about tasty grilled chicken strips accompanied by grilled veggies made my deep deep inner skinny person rejoice.   Unfortunately I was pretty underwhelmed both times I tried them.   The chicken and the veggies both just tasted very bland to me.   Maybe every delicious fried chicken finger I've had from Raising Cane's and other establishments has tainted my taste buds.

Baked:  Tried this for the first time a few weeks back.   Better than the grilled for sure due to the seasoning, but not anything that has me craving a return visit.  With this order I had the fries, which I did enjoy quite a bit.   But I mean, they're FRIES.   Hot, crispy and well seasoned though.   

Fried:  The best of the three, but to reiterate the point: it's fried chicken, of course it's good.  The panko breading definitely make it unique to most other versions you can find elsewhere, but not necessarily better tastewise.   And to make an unhealthy choice worse I got the mac and cheese with it the one time I tried it.   A good version for sure, but it didn't exactly set itself apart from most other mac and cheeses that I've had.

The stars of the show here are the dipping sauces.   The wide variety of them provide for a lot of different tasting experiences and most of the ones I tried were extremely tasty.   My favorites are the sweet chili and wasabi cream, and in particular I liked combining those two for a sweet/spicy combo.   You can be like Bill Nye the Science Guy and experiment on your own combinations.  Bring the kids, they'll have a blast.

So overall it's good food, and the price isn't too bad, but it doesn't exactly light my world on fire either.   See you in 8 months or so Strip N Dip!
Strip N Dip two years later and still doin it right!!!!! I love this place and their amazing food :) also the new soda machine and renovations are awesome. So happy this chain has evolved an come so far!
Hot, fresh, tender and great service. Recommended by friend and I recommend it too.  Small owner operator shop with counter service and a few tables.  Worth a try!
I had the opportunity to eat at this place. My coworker gave me a coupon and another coworker and I, went there for lunch.

The strips can be ordered fried, baked or grilled.

You have a choice of sides, fires, mac and cheese or grilled vegetables.

They have one of the mega selection soda machines, which I like, better than the burger kings, with the same machines, which doesn't have the add-on flavorings like cherry. ( To be fair, the burger king I was in, was the first time I saw this mega machine, the other locations may keep their's stocked)

We both had the four strips fried, with mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was great, I saw the person at the next table was having the grilled vegetables, they looked great, I asked, he said they were excellent. I will definitely have to try them. First time there, I didn't know.

They have a large selection of dipping sauces, buffalo, ranch, teriyaki, wasabi cream, sweet chili, bbq, honey mustard, bfg (think Cane's) and cheese.

Now to the strips. I don't understand this, I had 4 strips, two were perfect, two were rubbery. I got the impression they cooked them when you order them, I still have that impression. The strips were the same size, how can they come out different.

If I had four of the of the perfect strips, I would have given a 4. if I had four of the rubbery ones, I would have given a 1.

I gave a 3 because of the mac and cheese was great, two of the strips were good and the soda mach was fully stocked.

I will try it again, in hopes of getting 4 good strips.
As Jimmy Fallon would say, "So Great!" It is worth the drive off strip to get some good food. The Mac and cheese is outstanding, the fried strips were juicy and awesome, they even have one of those fancy touchscreen coke machines!  I liked the strip sauce and teriyaki.  Staff was friendly. Quaint little joint, will visit again next time in in Vegas.
I don't feel it's necessary to describe and break down the menu for you (hundreds of people have already done this) so I am writing this review to tell all the helpers that this place is the perfect remedy for a chicken strip craving. The eclectic menu has something to offer for all. If you feel like binging, get the fried strips with Mac n cheese on the side. If you want to be healthy, go with baked with a side of veggies. 

I personally think the baked and fried are the best strips. The wasabi cream sauce is delicious. They also have Thai tea. Yay.
The owner greets you as though he is truly interested in you enjoying your experience in his restaurant, and I believe this guy will do very well...for a very long time. 

If you love chicken strips...don't eat them anywhere else again until you have had them here...and then go in understanding that you will never want to eat them anyplace else, ever again. 

The chicken strips are so good here they make you want to slap your momma. 
(For serving you the substandard ones you grew up eating.) 

Fast, friendly service, rewards cards, and an array of food choices that make it a little tough to decide what to try every time but....Just. Stay. Focused! You came for the chicken strips, which can be ordered baked, fried or grilled. Then comes an equally tough choice... the dipping sauces. The sweet chili and creamy wasabi are my personal favorites, and there are perhaps 10 others. The obligatory blue cheese and ranch are also far above average.
 
The chicken portions are very generous, and regardless of how you order your strips they are served hot and super moist. It appears to be all white meat, and is obviously extremely fresh. 

As for the extensive choice for side dishes, I have enjoyed every one I have tried to date, however the mac and cheese is in the comfort food hall of fame. It is such a ridiculously cut above any mac & cheese I have ever had, that I could easily see myself stopping in at Strip & Dip just for an order to dine in, and one more for the road. 

The place is clean, the atmosphere is very laid back and welcoming, and if I lived just a little closer...I could be in serious trouble...at some point they may have to tell me to go home once in while.

My grandchildren ask to eat here often, which actually makes quite a statement in and of itself, since they have fairly refined palettes, due to their Dad being a bit of a foodie.
This place is pretty easy to miss especially since it's a small building and it's located in such a big plaza. Strip n Dip is located right next to Home Depot. 

Came here for lunch. They had combos with six, four or two chicken strips. It comes with your choice of one side. Drinks NOT included. Customer service was great. I told the cashier this was my first time here and he explained the menu to me and a little bit about how Strip n Dip came to establishment.

I ordered the "kids meal" with 2 baked chicken strips (choose between: fried, baked or grilled) and I chose the infamous mac n cheese that other Yelpers raved about as my side. You also get your choice of one dipping sauce. The buffalo sauce was yummy. Total cost was $4.79 I also ordered a 20 oz. iced thai coffee for $1.99. Two dollars for iced coffee!?! Sure...don't mind if I do. The coffee was pretty good too. They also had thai iced tea too. Hmmm...interesting...I would NEVER imagine they would have thai drinks at a chicken strip place. 

This would be a perfect lunch size for all you small/light eaters. The two chicken strips were kinda on the small side but with the mac n cheese...it filled me up perfectly. (don't want to over-indulge here). I'm not a fan of mac n cheese but this.....THIS was DELICIOUS!!! The baked cheese they added on top really made this stand out from your typical boring mac n cheese. The mac n cheese alone was enough to make this review a four star rating. 

So...the reason why I can't give this a full 5 stars is because of some "rounding fee" they do on our transaction. I wasn't even aware until a fellow Yelper told me about it. I checked my receipt and it said "due rounding: $0.01." Yes, yes I know...it's only 1 cent. But still...what's up with this!?! I've NEVER, EVER seen this before in my life. Literally. 

But even with this "due rounding" fee, would I be back?? Of course I would. Whenever I'm craving for some chicken strips..I'll swing by here. Next time, if I have a bigger appetite, I would order 4 strips and I would like to try the fries.
I had a great experience here. The cashier, Rashaad was great! Made us feel very welcome, he went over the menu with us since it was our first time coming in to strip n dip chicken strips, and he was very friendly.

I like that they offer 3 different types or chicken strips and a variety of sauces. So far my favorite is the grilled chicken strips. I can't wait to try out the other delicious options on the menu.
Matt you had me at "Hello". Simple menu and in this instance that works well.
Great fried tenders sauces are good. mac and cheese is great for a side. heathy options of grilled veggie available. Most impressive is the service from the moment you approach the register. great job on that point. I think that customer service athough talked about is often not implemented. In this joint it's part of the experience.
Great for when you're living on a college budget like me, Strip N Dip is fast food that is super cheap! 

They have great customer service: the one guy working was super friendly and welcoming. He even opened the door for us! 

The food is legit for how much it is, but it ain't perfect. you can get chicken baked, fried, or grilled & choose between a variety of different sauces. I recommend their strip sauce :) Don't get the BBQ sauce, it's a little odd tasting! Then I also ordered Thai Tea because I was excited to taste a cheaper cup of my favorite tea and it was pretty good!! 

Also, the Choco funnel cake is good, but they put a little too much powdered sugar! ;) so break into your wallet a bit and have fun eating!!
Wow! My first time here and this place is just awesome. First of all the staff is super friendly. A young African male helped my partner and I. He explained the menu to us in such an enthusiastic detail. Attention Boss! That man needs a bonus. He definitely made the experience a hundred times better.
I couldnt finish my chickin finger because they were way to greesy.  but the mac n cheese was great!!
Food is awesome and the staff couldn't be more friendly. I use this spot for catering with my business here in Vegas and always a good value!! (They should raise their prices on catering orders!) cool Peeps!
The food is always amazing. And cheap! I would recommend this place to absolutely anyone! The staff is friendly and always cares about their customers being comfortable. The prices are very affordable and are more than worth it when it comes to the quality!
Crisp Panko bread crumbs chicken strips, delightful fries and flavorful garlic bread were the highlights. Sauces were hit or miss. Location needed cleaning, but staff was friendly. I would return again
Super friendly, helpful staff. Food was good, Mac and cheese is the go to. The strips were good but I really prefer a batter rather than bread crumbs.
Had a wonderful time eating here last night. I feel horrible we did not get the name of the wonderful man working the front counter. He is amazing at his job. 
The amount of food you get is just right for the price. Almost all the sauces are made in store and are delicious. The breading on the fried strips is a little different but the baked strips are just amazing so no issue here. Love the rewards program. We will be back for sure.
Found this place looking for something to eat. I was going to a sandwich deli that was in the same lot but was closed. What a great find very unique clean food. If I lived on this side of town I would stop by frequently.
Very simple yet diverse menu. They have three different ways they cook their chicken and they all taste great. No matter which way you get it, its healthy eating. They have grilled vegetables to go with your grilled or baked chicken which by the way is 100% real chicken, white meat at that. They have several different sauces and depending on what count of strips you order, you'll get your choice of either two or three sauces. 

The customer service is what it should be anywhere you go. The food is great and the price is right, but I keep coming back because the owner makes it a point to know your name and if you're a first-timer, he'll ask if you'd like to have your picture taken and posted on social media, usually FB. The owner is a local kid in his mid-twenties and a graduate of UNLV who seems to have a passion for quality and not quantity. 

He seems to be on point with staff selection because his staff is a reflection of him. They recenly expanded their menu to include deserts and other items. They have a very wide variety of soft drinks and healthy drinks. They have a reward program that they recently kicked off but I haven't had it long enough to give a review on it. 

The establishment is always clean including the bathroom and the decor is appropriate. This is place you have to try at least once. The only reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5 (I'd give it 4.5 if it was possible) is because of the fact that the place is small. The bathroom is basically right in the middle of the place right off the dining area, which is probably why they maintain it so clean. I don't think the owner anticipated the popularity the place would gain but if things keep going the way they are they will need a bigger place.
Great place bra. Chicken is super good bra. You know what I mean bra. 

The guy who runs this place is pretty nice/funny. I had a bit of an addiction problem with this place a while back and he remembered me after not having gone there in at least 9 months if not a year. 


This place is pretty awesome. For6 dollars you get chicken (BFG, which is what I will always call this place) , garlic bread, a side, and 2 delicious sauces. The honey mustard and strip sauce, ahem, I mean BFG sauce are the best IMO. The mac and cheese is also pretty good. As long as it isn't busy you get your food super fast. 

The random special items have all been pretty good when I got them- nachos, hot dog thing, funnel cake- whats not to love? 

Good to go ordering- never got there after the allotted amount of time and had to wait, food was always ready. 

They now have the 300 flavor coke machine which doesn't hurt either.
1st time since it changed name/ownership. Food was GREAT! Ordered the 6 piece combo with the velvety, scrumptious Mac & Cheese. The chicken was yummy- love the coating! The Wasabi kicks ass!! The strip sauce was "fine". The buffalo sauce was tasty!

The service was great- our food was brought to us by the manager/owner? He was very personable!

It's obvious they need a bigger space. The big fly in the ointment was the family of 5 that made the word "boisterous" pale in comparison to the decibel piercing shrieks, laughter and abnormally loud voices of the "adult" and 4 kids of varying ages. I have heard air horns less intrusive...
This place is AMAZING! It definitely beats the old raising canes!!! Let me start by saying the food is great. You can choose from three different options: fried chicken, grilled or baked. I personally like them fried. The food is so fresh and you can get vegetable skewers on the side if you don't want yucky fries and cole slaw like at canes ew! The food is made with love and care and the owner even works rite inside the store. He is the nicest, sweetest man. Very young and well mannered for his age. Please don't miss out on this one. It may be  a little hard to find for someone who isn't familiar with the area. It is in the home depot parking lot. Don't miss out on this great food and not to mention very reasonably priced..
BEST MAC AND CHEESE EVER!!!!   If you love cheese this the place for you...
They were wonderful at helping us order... They put out good vibes so I'm going to make sure I tell everyone!!!
Tucked into a blink-and-you'll-miss-it nook on the edge of a shopping plaza between a Ross and the Home Depot, this specialty chicken place has a few surprises in store.

Service is top-notch: we were immediately greeted, walked through the menu, invited to join their loyalty program, and made to feel that our business was appreciated. Our food was brought out, we were checked on throughout our visit, and given a goodbye as we walked out the door- all with a smile by the gentleman behind the counter.

As for the food: BF got a 6 piece fried with a side of mac, I opted for the 4 piece rotisserie with a side of veggies, and we added on a hot chick and a thai tea- the latter mostly because since when have I ever been able to get chicken strips and thai tea in the same place? Bizarre but lovely. The drink was out right away and just a smidge less sweet than I am used to. $2 cup is well-priced.

The chicken arrived hot and tasty: BF surprisingly preferred the grilled while I preferred the panko breading for the fried version. We tried several different sauces including the ranch (nothing interesting), wasabi (nice with just a little kick), honeymustard (light but not my thing), strip sauce (my favorite), and buffalo (my second favorite, dude's preferred dip). BF put it well: he'd come back for the grilled strips tossed in buffalo sauce, but the rest of the menu seemed too similar to Raisin' Cane's for his liking, and he's a huge fan of theirs.

As for the sides: the mac was super indulgent and better than the mac I've had at more formal or high-end places. Loved that the dish was still gooey and cheesy instead of dried out, which I run into a lot at places that call themselves "southern" or boast about being "homestyle". Dude, if I made this mac at home, I'd never leave... because I'd weigh 500 pounds. It's good, but definitely only get if you went to the gym that day, there's a lot of guilt involved with that much pasta and cheese.
The grilled veggies were a surprise hit with BF, he'd tack those on to his future grilled-with-buffalo purchase.

Lastly, the hot chick was oddly again one of my favorite things: a simple fried strip doused in buffalo sauce (sensing a theme?) and placed in a small bun with lettuce and tomato, it's simple and it's delicious. There's  meal option for two of those with a side, and I'd likely consider it in the future.

Final note about their loyalty program: tracks your purchase spendings by the dollar, when you reach a $60 total you get a free meal. I didn't ask for more details but I do like that it tracks with your phone number rather than yet another pesky key tag or card to keep track of.
Not a great place for chicken. Fried was bland, mac and cheese tasteless, grilled strips were OK. Great service and ambience, but as a restaurant, not phenomenal overall.
Today, I ordered by far, the best fried (and suprisingly affordable) chicken ever!!! The Pablo breading gave it a perfect crunch, and their handmade sauces were to die for! The owner and the employees' hospitality and sense of humor are great, and they even gave me a free drink just because their machine was temporarily broken earlier! You habmve to come here for some great hospitality, and great chicken.
Today was my first time trying this place and I'm definitely satisfied.  I got the grilled chicken, mac and cheese and garlic bread. I chose the bbq, strip sauce and wing sauce for my dips and all were fantastic. 

Make your portions bigger. I'm still hungry for more! :) Thanks guys!
Chicken strip place that has Thai tea?!?!Completely sold! My boyfriend and I both got the combo of fried chicken strips and mac n cheese with wasabi cream and buffalo sauce, chicken nachos, and a Thai tea. All the food we got was extremely tasteful! The wasabi cream really does taste like wasabi but not too hot, but it's a great combination with the chicken strips. Also, the chicken strips weren't dry at all; you probably could eat it w/o any sauce at all. The chicken nachos were very flavorful as well. 

Customer service is as good as it gets! The girl at the counter was so friendly and helpful when I couldn't decide which sauce to get. There was one worker who walked around asking if everyone was doing ok, and when he got around to my boyfriend and I, he wanted to make sure our Thai tea was light on ice like how we ordered. We said that the amount of ice in our Thai tea was ok, but he gave us another Thai tea (on the house) with little amount of ice! 

I definitely will come back whenever I get the chance. The customer service and the food is worth every cent you pay!
Do yourself a favor and go try this place. You would never imagine the food is as heavenly as it is. The grilled and fried strips are pieces of heaven, same with the veggie skewers. I may go again tonight, simply amazing!
Very good chicken tenders where you can get it baked, fried or grilled.  There's different types of sauces and it makes the joy of being their fun.
1st time since it changed name/ownership. Food was GREAT! Ordered the 6 piece combo with the velvety, scrumptious Mac & Cheese. The chicken was yummy- love the coating! The Wasabi kicks ass!! The strip sauce was "fine". The buffalo sauce was tasty!

The service was great- our food was brought to us by the manager/owner? He was very personable!

It's obvious they need a bigger space. The big fly in the ointment was the family of 5 that made the word "boisterous" pale in comparison to the decibel piercing shrieks, laughter and abnormally loud voices of the "adult" and 4 kids of varying ages. I have heard air horns less intrusive...

We'll be back though (w/ earplugs) ...
I drove off-strip to this little "hole in the wall joint" based solely on my ailing wallet, and yelp. 

I was not at all disappointed. I actually really enjoyed my experience. Staff was friendly, price was cheap, and most importantly the food was delish. I consider myself a chicken strips guy. They do seem a little juvenile, but damn a good fried piece of white chicken breast is just stellar for me. The strips might be considered small in size, but definitely made up for in numbers. The breading is very light but crispy nonetheless. Not very greasy in combination with the thin breading really highlighted the juice of the chicken. I got to try three different sauces. The baked mac was fab too!

I would put this in my list for spots to hit up in vegas when I have the time and the soberity. Yeah it is 15 min from the strip, but who cares! You can go fill up your gas tank for cheap and get away from the crowd for an hour.
Only went in for a drink, but for customer service alone, they get 5 stars.  Super friendly staff!
The staff was very friendly and informative, being my first time going there it definitely helped. The menu is simple but their chicken is flavorful! About 9 different sauce choices; I loved the wasabi cream and honey mustard.  All in all a great place to grab a quick lunch!
Had strip n dip three times first two times had fried chicken strips w bbq sauce and fries and cherry dr pepper omgosh it was very good. Then two weeks ago or so I wanted to try something different so I got the chicken fries and it was not what was advertised one they didn't.close container all the way so ninety percent to my fries fell out but I did taste the one left , and it was eww nasty......So ill.stick to the fried fingers because they are taste y
Killer chicken fingers! The wasabi cream sauce is amazing. Great family run operation which provides excellent customer service and food
Disappointing , because of the other high reviews I wanted to give this place a try. chicken strips were teeny tiny , the baked chicken strips were flavorful but the fried had a really weird flavor, friendly service and cool drink machine. Wouldn't recommend
EVERYTHING is AWESOME here! 
Try EVERYTHING!! The staff is super cool-
the menu rocks- Plus they have the amaZeballs pop machine with all the crazy flavors ;)  do yourself a favor & check this place out- they'll change the way you feel about chicken lol TRUST ME!
Not bad, service was on the slower side, but then again it was lunch time 12-1pm but very friendly and quick cashier
Chicken fingers with a couple of homemade sauces and some Mac and cheese #nightcomplete.  Highly recommend this place, the food is great and most of all the staff and manager are x10 as friendly.  Must try! I can definitely see them expanding over the valley in the near future. 

Good luck guys.
This place is amazing! The service is super helpful and upbeat. There is something for everyone. The food is yum! Wish it was closer to the northwest side!
I've been a fan of this place ever since it was called BFG. Two things always get the Mac n cheese and get the wasabi cream dipping sauce. I love the menu, they keep it simple and easy to order.
They used to be called BFG and were a great simple restaurant. Since then, they are now called Strip N Dip and offer a wider variety of items to choose from. I personally enjoy their nachos and like that they have a fries option as well. Will eat here again as it is pretty much still the same as BFG with a little more. Service was also a little quicker than before. Cool soda machine.

Only downfall is that their prices have changed and are a little more expensive for the same food... I used to visit often for the pricing but it's not horrible still...
So apparently I missed the era in which this place was a 5 star?! First visited this place last week and was quite impressed/pleased with everything?... Not sure why some of the low ratings. People need to understand costs are going up everywhere, hence, why business owners need to increase prices. "If you no like, go to KFC!" Simple as that.

Let's start with customer service: This lil family owned hole in the wall that is easily missed if you are not paying attention is on a fine mission to smother you with niceness! One of the workers held the door open for us as we walked in :-0 ...Oh-and as I walked in, I overheard her tell another customer if their experience eating there was not up to their expectations, she would "take care of them" at their next visit! That's a strong statement, Strip N Dip, we will hold you to your word! The cashier was extremely friendly and helpful in explaining their menu items and filling us in on what the popular picks were. The wait was not long and our food was delivered promptly. 

Establishment: Took off a star because we did not have the option to eat at the restaurant due to overcrowding. Seating is very limited so we took our food to go. Maybe if the place was a little bigger, people would not be forced to take their food to go and have to experience a case of "cold food." No bueno.

Food: The deep fried chicken strips were amaze-balls! Very tender and flavorful. The Mac & Cheese.......OMG, the Mac & Cheese......SO F'ing GOOD!!!!!!! (for a lack of better words.) Do not come here and NOT order the Mac & Cheese because you will miss out on the full experience. Also, a hot pick here is the nachos. Holy bejezus! These are addicting! 

Honestly, for a first timer, I would recommend the nachos, Mac & Cheese and if room available, have the fried chicken strips. :-)
So the food is great. Been going for a while and maybe for the last time. They round the bill up to nearest nickel. WTF so your taking more money for what use? That is stealing to me. Over time it adds up
I have found my chicken strip spot next to the vicinity in which I call work. The name of the game here is OPTIONS, ALL OF THE OPTIONS. It merits caps, really, it does. It also has an awesome name. Come on, admit it, it does. 

Food: They have 3 meal deals. They are the following: A 6 strip combo, which comes with 6 chicken strips, 1 side, 3 sauces, a garlic bread, and a drink (20 oz).  3 Strip Combo comes with 3 strips, 2 sauces, a garlic bread, and drink. (That's the one I usually get, as it's just the right amount of food and it's ohhh so good.) Lastly, the 2 strip meal which has 2 strips, 1 side, 1 sauce, and a kids sized drink (12 oz). 
- Here is the fun part. THE OPTIONS, YAY! You can get your chicken either baked, grilled, or fried. I'm a fan of their grilled chicken, since deep fried food doesn't like me. Their baked chicken is decent, but in my option grilled is the way to go. They have a good variety of sauces too, and oh man, if you like sauces, you'll like this place. What kind of sauces do they have, you ask? Well kids, here's a list: BBQ, Buffalo (one I always get), Strip Sauce, Cheese, Honey Mustard, Ranch, Sweet Chili, Teriyaki, and Wasabi Cream. I've tasted the Buffalo, Ranch, Strip Sauce, Cheese, and Teriyaki and I'm a fan. The teriyaki was a little weird and not one of my favorites, but it wasn't by any means horrible.  Oh yeah, you also get that side! Their sides are mac and cheese, french fries, or grilled veggies. Their mac and cheese is decent for fast food, and their french fries are pretty good as well. None of them are something to write home to mother about, but hey, you are coming here for the chicken anyway, right? I hope so. 
- Service: So far so good! The people working there are friendly, tell you about their loyalty program and like to make you smile. It can get busy during lunch so there is a little bit of wait time, but nothing compared to some places. 

I say try it once, at least for the sauces and chicken. Everything I've tasted there has been om nom nomable to the extreme and it has now became my go to place for chicken at work. :D Keep it classy Strip N Dip.
Great food!  Great, personalized service.  We're from out of town and read the reviews.  We wanted to eat somewhere "off" the strip.  Something good but less expensive.  This was a great choice.  It is somewhat like fast food, but there are healthy choices, grilled chicken and vegetable skewers.  And, the not so healthy, to die for, Mac and Cheese.  YUM!
Wow! The service was both friendly and exceptional, Bree(?) helped us at the register and her enthusiasm in selling us chicken strips left me stunned and humbled.
Incredibly accommodating, they have a good variety in the menu and condiments, which will be familiar to a lot of Asians as they have Thai Tea and Sriracha.
The baked rotisserie chicken strips were a tantalizing experience, albeit short-lived.
Friendly service. Fresh food. Great taste!!! Tons of soft drinks options.  The chicken nachos with fries instead of chips are amazing!! Love love this place.
My boyfriend and I stopped in the other day after taking an exam. I was excited about the fact that I had choices other than fried chicken strips. I had baked chicken strips and grilled veggies. Everything was seasoned well. The chicken was moist and juicy. The boyfriend had fried chicken strips and mac and cheese. He loved it. The guy that served us was super friendly. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience. I will definitely go back if I'm ever on that side of town. The only downfall is that we don't have this joint in Henderson!
Meh, so-so...don't really see what the fuss is about.  This was my first visit here.  The chicken is decent (small pieces, mind you), but that's about it.  Stick with the Sweet Chili or Wasabi Cream dipping sauces...their Ranch and BFG sauces were outright awful.  The sides and bread were average at best, including the Mac & Cheese other reviewers raved about.  Bottom line...they ain't got nothing on Raising Cane's!

Service on my visit was definitely sub-par.  The boss (the only guy not in uniform) was very preoccupied giving freebies to a scragly looking biker customer and his two little miracles...a big, bald Ginger complete with ZZ Top beard, a black "Vatos Locos" t-shirt and unkept Ruger P-85 semi-auto strapped to his side.  Further, the cashier was perturbed that I would not forfeit my phone number for text specials.

Since I wasn't impressed and don't like possibly being caught in crossfire, I won't be back.
This was my first here! And it definitely won't be my last. I was greeted by Rashaad. Such a sweetheart. Helped me with my decisions, explained everything thoroughly & even opened the door for me on the way out. From start to finish, everything was absolutely perfect. Oh yeah.. & The food is DELICIOUS!
Really good lunch spot! The main item is chicken strip which you can get baked, grilled or fried. I usually get grilled or fried.  You can select from a multitude of sauces, from the standard bbq, teriyaki to their wonderful wasabi. For sides, the mac n cheese is great, but I try to stick with grilled veggies. 

Service is great - staff is friendly and happy to answer any questions etc. After going a few times, a couple of the staff address me by name, which is a nice touch! 

As a few yelpers already mentioned, space is a bit tight if it gets busy, but that doesn't detract from the service and food. 

Try 'em out, you won't be disappointed.
Another awesome experience with the family! Ub40 and Bob Marley for the tunes a place that remember your name! Points for your frequent fliers.
Ordered food from here for pickup. When I called, customer service was wonderful. When I came to pick the food up, was a different story. There were three people ahead of me and two behind the cash register. One person was helping customers,  the other was on his phone texting. Unprofessional in my opinion but the place smelt like heaven so I let it go. 
We ordered one 6 piece fried strip with Mac n cheese and one 6 piece grilled strip combo with veggies. 
First off, the pieces are TINY so I'm glad we ordered the six piece combo. The grilled strips were flavorless. The veggies consisted of two kabobs filled with onions, bell peppers and one or two pieces of zucchini or squash or whatever it was. The fried strips were good. The man n cheese was dry, bland. Disappointed because it looked so delicious on the website. Don't think we will be going here again.
I underestimated the girl who works the front register as she was very young and spoke very fast. She actually knew everything about the menu and was very helpful with recommendations. I have never eaten here before. What tops it all off is she knew how to spell my name without my dumbing it down and spelling it out to her. It's nice to finally come across a younger person who listens and has initiative. The food was great as well. Thank you!
Stop #3 for Joy's Bachlorette Food Tour.  *Pointing at herself* chicken strip queen right here. I love all things chicken -most of the time, ALL the time!-
While driving through this part of Vegas, I was surprised to see a Raising Cane's close by! But in all honesty, let's get one thing straight. You cannot compare the two. I mean, you can but they aren't the same animal. SND has more options for sure... And they both have crispy chicken that relies on their sauces for overall flavor. So, there you have it. Just my two cents.

What I enjoyed:
-Crispy panko crust. Hot and juicy. Practically burned my tongue off. 
-They are never frozen, meaning it's fresh.
-I like having options. Want to be a tad bit more healthy? Order it grilled. Maybe baked.
-Grilled veggies? Yup! We had a vegan and vegetarian in our party so they liked that!
-Staff. So friendly! They even took an Instagram photo of our party.

What was okay:
-I thought the Mac & Cheese was on the runny side. So sue me! I loved the cheesy meltyness on top, but I didn't like cracking open the inside.
-The sauces. Not terrible. Might give the wasabi cream a try next time!
My boyfriend and I come here often! Such a simple menu, yet such great choices and menu items! The staff is EXTREMELY friendly and their customer service is EXCEPTIONAL! 

I'm hoping to see them open up more spots across the city!!
Let's start off with the best Mac N' Cheese ever. Loving the combo of Chicken Strips and Mac N' Cheese. Very affordable and tasty. The only downfall is 20 minutes away from me.
Amazing fried chicken strips, baked mac & cheese + chicken nachos! It definitely hit the spot .. They have GREAT customer service especially from one of the managers Rashad. Even though this place is far from where I live I will definitely be coming back
This place has the vibe of a thriving establishment, and the food was amazing. All the food was fresh and the chicken tasted better than any other place I've been to. A large amount of sauces to choose from was cool, and there were even healthier options like grilled or baked chicken, salads, and grilled veggies. But what was even better was the staff. They were very friendly and connected with us, and got our orders to us as fast as they could. So if you're rolling by this place, be sure to stop here!
Delicious food and friendly service, the same as when it was BFG. The only real difference I can spot is that we no longer can get those awesome weekly specials. :( They also now have a points based rewards program to earn free meals.
Working at a call center we always tried different restaurants I. The area just to stop getting the same things over and over. Their food is always cooked fresh and they make their own sauces that are to die for. Everything I've tried from this place was super delicious and I recommend this place to everyone.
Great chicken and sauces. The thai coffee and thai tea were great too! Only complaint is use of styrofoam.
Love loved it. They offer a healthy alternative 
We found the menu simple and something for everybody. Kind of fell into finding this place and it was a great surprise.  My kids liked the food do that was a good plus too
(TL;DR - extra crispy and moist chicken fingers and a unique sauce selection for the sauce advocate. Wasabi cream is what sauce dreams are made of!)

As far as chicken fingers goes, this place is the place to be. I'm not often finding myself craving chicken fingers, but it's a simple and no-fuss type of meal.

We went with the 6 piece fried chicken finger combo with garlic bread, and added a side of fries, baked mac and cheese, and extra, extra sauce. The chicken fingers were simple, nicely seasoned, super crispy, and surprisingly moist inside. You can also opt for baked or grilled chicken and add vegetables for a lighter fare.

The side of fries was a heaping size. They topped off an entire to-go container. They were standard shoe string fries, crispy and simple. I loved dipping my fries in their sauces. Also, the baked mac and cheese was bubbling hot, comforting, and very cheesy. We enjoyed every cheesy bite. 

My favorite thing about this place is definitely their sauces! They have a great variety of unique sauces. We tried the wasabi cream, honey mustard, and sweet chili. The wasabi cream and honey mustard were both delicious, but the wasabi cream is what dreams are made of! It had a sophisticated flavor, like it was from a classy upscale dining establishment. I dunked all of my fries and chicken into that sauce, it was incredible. On the other hand, I didn't care for the sweet chili too much. It tasted artificial and bottled to me, but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Fast, easy, and cheap comfort food, plus friendly service! A good reason to stop in again to try their other sauces!
Customer service is over the top.  They remember your name, open doors, greet everyone with a smile.  I like the choice of either breaded or grilled chicken fingers.  Plus the individual macaroni and cheese side is creamy and cheesy with a nice burnt, in a good way, top.  Get there!
Mmmm their chicken strips are bomb! I got them fried which is breaded in panko, so they are the perfect size with the right amount of crunch to them. I got the 4 piece combo and chose of side of Mac and cheese that was baked to perfection! After given the option of what I'd like to drink I noticed they had Thai tea on the menu. I've never been to a place where they offered American comfort food with Thai tea. Just that little detail totally completed my experience there :)
Love the chicken strips here! I usually get the fried (panko crusted) strips, but the baked is not a bad choice if you want a healthier option. The strips always come out hot, and the meat is never dry. The 4 piece combo is the perfect amount for me. 

I always get the strip sauce and buffalo sauce. All of the sides are delicious, but I recommend the mac & cheese or french fries.

They have a rewards system and will ask you for your phone number. So if you're a regular, you can get a free meal every so often! Overall, Strip N Dip is a must go.
It's good! The chicken is really little so a average person could probably eat a 6 piece. I didn't even get full. Mac is good and the fries! Everyone talks about the wasabi cream it is disgusting taste like nail polish remover! Best sauce is the strip sauce and the hot chick sauce!
I had the the deep friend chicken strips which weren't anything
to write home about. 

As far as any dipping sauces, there wasn't anything unique or
fresh about it. 

With all of the above being said, the pricing can be considered overpriced
for some chicken strips which you practically can get from any fast food place.

Not impressed to say the least and will probably not return.
Nothing extraordinary about the taste. Simple delicious classic food. Loved the sweet chili sauce though. However, the service was impeccable. They're friendly, fast and show equal concern towards every customer. It was a complete wonderful experience.
After hearing mixed review about Strip N Dip since it changed from BFG, I wasn't in a rush to go try it. However, being in the neighborhood the other day I decided to give it a go and I'm glad I did.

Friendly service & good food at a decent price. Portion size was decent for the price and the quality of the food. We had the panko fried chicken with side of mac & cheese. I will definitely go back to try baked and grilled chicken.... the nachos also sound awesome.
loved the mac and cheese and chicken strips.  My favorite dippin sauces are the BBQ and the teriyaki sauce. yummers!
This was my first time here and I had an overall good experience. Rashon was the manager working and he was awesome and really made my experience great. The food was pretty good. I think the chicken strips could be a little bit bigger but they weren't too bad. They had nice flavor to them and were juicy. I had ranch and honey mustard as my sauces. honey mustard was a little different than most places and I liked it a lot. Ranch tasted like ranch but Rashon let me try the creamy wasabi sauce and that blew me away. Not only was it different but it tasted awesome. Most of the sauces are hand made. Mac and cheese was my side. Wasn't a whole lot to the Mac and cheese but it tasted good and the cheese was fully melted and creamy. I would definitely recommend this place if you have never been. They are great for catering.
Fortunately enough to swing by for a soft opening! Great place to grab a snack before or after a movie at MAC. Sampled the chocolate chip waffle bites sprinkled with powdered sugar and a side of syrup.

Can't wait to try the waffles wrapped hot dogs.

Thanks to a buddy posting the opening on fb ...I just happen to be in the area.
The food wasn't "bad,", but it wasn't great either. The service was terrible. For that reason alone, we won't be back.
Very cool and different place! Waffles and hot dogs or both. I'm not really a hot dog fan but the waffles are amazing! They have a cinnamon flavor to them and you can put any toppings you want on/in it. My favorite is peanut butter and honey. Great price and quick service. Definitely will be going back!
This place is so cool! How some waffle poppers and took a journey around what they had to offer. Very cool :)
DELICIOUS!! Amazing Chicken and Waffles. The restaurant is located as part of the food court at Fiesta Mall, but it feels like you're sharing a bit of home. The owners provide REAL flatware (rare for a food court), your own caraffe of syrup, and your own bottle of hot-sauce. The owners were engaging and helpful. The food was made-to-order and was absolutely delicious. Recommended!!
I've been to this place twice now and had a pretty good experience both times.  The first time, about a week ago, I got the basic Chicken and Waffle combo.  The chicken came out piping hot.  Both were delicious.  The only problem I had was five minutes after I got my food and before it had a chance to cool off, a security guard came up to me and told me the food court (and the mall) were closing in 15 minutes, hardly enough time for the food to cool off enough to eat it.  It was a Sunday so they closed early.  I would have enjoyed my food more if I hadn't had to rush.

The second time was yesterday.  I got the Fish with One Side combo.  The credit card machine must have been out or something, there was a sign saying they could only take cash.  I got collard greens as my side.  The fish was excellent and my grandson loved it too and kept getting bites of it from me.  The tarter sauce tasted homemade.  I wish there had been more than one piece of fish, tho it was pretty big (see photo).  The collard greens had wonderful flavor but were also way too salty for my taste.  The kind of salty that hurts your taste buds.  They were cooked with real ham that gave them their wonderful flavor, don't know if they added salt on top of it or if it was just that salty from the ham.

The man behind the counter, who is also the cook I think, was very nice, the kind of guy who welcomes you the first time, and more so as a return customer.

 I look forward to returning here, both for more chicken and to try other dishes.
Went for lunch today (12/6/12), and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. I ordered the Wild Boar burger (whoa, I ate wild boar!), and, although the patty was quite small, I was full at the end of the meal. The flavor of the burger/toppings was really nice, and the fries were great. Be warned, though, that burgers come with a small side of coleslaw, but any other sides (fries, sweet potato fries, etc) cost extra.

The guy I went with had the Bison Burger, and enjoyed it, though he did not like his sweet potato fries (they were "soggy").

It is a little pricey for lunch (approx. $20 if you get a burger with a side and drink), but at least you get a free warm chocolate-chip cookie at the end of your meal!!!   +1

Also, I love that the place is so new that it still smells like fresh-cut wood! Yum!
Came here for lunch on a Thursday with some co-workers.  

We left with mixed feelings, most of us disappointed and won't be back. 

This place is pretty new.  It opened in the space that Ian's Pizza moved out of.  They spent quite a bit of work to completely redo the interior.  They attempted to capture the up north feel, with lots of cedar wood and country decor.   There was a gas fireplace in the middle of the dining room which I really liked.  

I got the whitefish hoagie.   The menu said that all sandwiches were served with a side of sweet mustard cole slaw."   Hmm...I don't remember tasting any mustard, or any sweetness, or anything all.   It was weak, mostly watery cabbage with a touch of cream.    My sandwich was okay.  The red pepper aioli didn't stand out.  I actually thought it was melted cheese until I reviewed the menu just now.  There wasn't any tartar sauce served.

The sides are kind of a rip; especially the traditional fries.  They're a $3 add on and they could've easily been from the frozen section at Woodman's Foods.  

One of my co-workers got the Wild Boar Burger, fries, and a CAN of beer.  His bill was $17 before tip.   Seemed pretty steep for a lunch.  It'd be different if any of the 3 items were standout, but they were lacking.

One co-worker had the grilled cheese sandwich with fig jam & sliced apples.  He was really happy with it.  Out of our group of 5, he's the only one that said he'd come back.
We went to Buck & Badger last night with friends for dinner (6pm on a Saturday night).  When we arrived, there is a hostess stand right inside the front door with the usual "please wait to be seated" sign.  So we waited.....and waited...and waited.  No hostess appeared.  Two groups of people came in behind us and joined the wait for the elusive hostess.  The bar area was crowded and the bartenders definitely noticed the large crowd waiting to be seated, but made no move to summon a hostess.  Finally, our friends texted us to let us know they were already at a table (they had asked the hostess to let us know, but since she had disappeared, we didn't get the message).  So we went to sit down- I never saw the groups behind us come into the dining room, so I am guessing they got fed up waiting and left.  
Our waitress was very pleasant and friendly and brought us our drinks right away.  As a previous poster mentioned, the beer came in cans, even though there is a full bar with plenty of beer on tap.  Two of us ordered the bison burger, which was just ok- it was pretty small (the waitress said it was 1/3 lb, but it seemed smaller) and definitely NOT worth the $11 price, especially considering that sides are not included and cost extra.  The regular french fries were pretty lackluster- maybe a step up from McDonald's fries, and the sweet potato fries were soggy.  My fiance said the whitefish hoagie was nothing special and our friend who had the french fried cheese said it was not very good.  There were some decent parts of the meal, our friends noted that the twice baked potato and french onion soup were delicious.  At the end of the meal we were given a plate of chocolate chip cookies, which were ok, but they were basically just mass produced cookies that had been warmed in the microwave to make them seem fresh-baked.  I would much rather they forget the cookies and just focus on serving better food.

Overall, we felt like the food was bland and very overpriced, and while our waitress was ok, the service in general was pretty poor.    We will not be going back.
I went to the Buck and Badger over the weekend.  

Background info: I was there at ten on Saturday night.  So it was a little busy but not crowded by any means.  I was at a table of ten where each person was ordering a single item (i.e. beer, water or soda).  Not too difficult?  Well the waitress was rude, slow and inaccurate.  I know ten is quite a bit but you are writing it down.

She was not prompt in checking in on us nor was she accurate.  I asked for my check and she said I owed for way more drinks.  I was the first one to pay, so she could have figured it out.  It took her ten minutes to come back to figure out she added too many items, after I told her exactly what was on my bill.  I paid my bill, then I found out I was still overcharged for one of my drinks.  

I did not have the menu when I ordered but my friend caught an overcharge.  She and I had the same items.  Overall, very disappointed in the service.  It is Saturday night get someone who can handle the pressure.  I would go there again but I would hope for another server.  

Otherwise, the beer selection, wine selection and fun items (shot skis AND paddles) were impressive.
I always get wary when a restaurant tries to hard to push a theme.  In this case, Buck and Badger is supposed to resemble an "Up North" restaurant with a stuffed moosehead (fake me thinks) and a log cabin motif. Nevertheless, I thought to give it a whirl as we biked down State Street on one of the first nice days of Spring.  The menu is typical American fare-wings, some salads, hamburgers made from the various animals (cow, boar, lamb, bison), and entrees.  I opted for the Duck Salad (no tomatoes)  while my 9 year old daughter went with the children's Mac and Cheese.  
The meal took a tad bit long to come out with our waiter coming out to inform us they made the salad with the tomatoes and were making me a new one.  I was happy to hear that until the second attempt at the salad came out.  Evidently, when I requested no tomatoes, the cook also thought Ihe/she should include any other vegetable-it was missing the red peppers, onions, and celery that the menu described  While the duck was well prepared and the apple cider vinaigrette adding a nice acid to cut through the richness of the duck, the salad lacked anything crunchy and therefore was forgettable.   
My daughter's mac and cheese was generous in size and I appreciated the fact that the sauce was homemade and well balanced.  Good but nothing to come back for.

Buck and Badger would do better if it lessened the schtick around the Northwoods (really, the kid's menu item comes with an antler crown which basically guarantees a therapy visit or two when they get older from the humiliation), reduced the size of their menu, and focused on delivering well executed meals.  While I would say that the restaurant won't be around long due to the amount of nearby competition (The Fountain, Coopers, etc), they probably will as the owner also owns the Capitol Tap Haus (yawn) and the Ivory Room (license to print money).
I feel pretty let down by my two experiences at Buck & Badger.

I've been for lunch and dinner. Both times, service was pretty slow, despite there not being many customers. I had the chicken pot pie ($13), which was served in a sort of upside down pyramid of a bowl... It looked large when it first came, but soon revealed itself to be shallow and a pretty sad portion for the price. It wasn' particularly flavorful either. My date had a burger, which he said was just ok. 

Went back a different day and had the grilled cheese with apples and fig spread. The apples turned out to be more like apple pie filling. Way too sweet! Also, $8 for a grilled cheese is quite steep, especially since you also have to pay extra to get a side of fries.

I would love to love Buck & Badger, since I work a block away and they have a lovely fireplace. I can imagine having lunch there while reading a book by the fire. But I guess what it comes down to, is there are much higher quality and less expensive places to go in the area.
I wasn't blown away by this place. The food was decent but the restaurant setting was good leaning toward great. It has a great feel to it and definitely is trying to bring a Northwoods feel to Madison. This was a spur of the moment stop for dinner. This is a place I could see myself stopping in more for the bar than to sit down for dinner.

Our waitress was great and it does have outside seating (however, I did not sit outside).

For those who are looking for a good root beer on tap this place does have Sprechers. 

Overall it was a good experience.
Ok, well, let's get a few things out of the way first.

This place isn't very big, so there's not much space to do anything. It's also kind of expensive when it comes to drinks around Madison. 

So why am I giving it four stars? Well, a drink purchase here can be used as the cover to get into the Ivory room, and the second, and much more important reason, is that they have shot skis.

SHOOOOOOOOT SKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIS!!!!!!!!!
Food is great. Flank steak meatloaf is amazing.  Duck breast is fabulous.   Unfortunately service is not. Two of us ordered soup this evening one came out with a the main course. Couldn't even fit it all on the table. My meal on the other hand never made it out she totally didn't even bring it.  This is 3rd time at his restaurant and service has been less than adequate.  Probably will not be back too many choices of great restaurants on State Street.
Although Buck and Badger has a whole section on their menu devoted to delicious looking meat burgers, I went against conventional wisdom and ordered their Veggie Burger. What the what?? I promise you it's good. The grilled portabella topped with grilled peppers and provolone cheese tastes almost like meat, if not better. Buck and Badger also has some really great cocktails (The One that Got Away, which is Jack Daniels Tennessee Honey with root beer, is tasty) as well as a large selection of beer. They also host Geeks Who Drink Trivia on Tuesdays.
Great overall experience.  The atmosphere and presentation were different but really cool. Food was a bit pricy but satisfying.
A friend recommended this place, so the other night while i was downtown I decided to check it out with a friend. We were there about 9:30pm and were seated immediately - we chose to have a seat inside. 
My friend ordered the steak sandwich and fries. He thought the sandwich was "fine." 
I ordered the "shoestring fries" which were just regular fries and were virtually tasteless; I didn't think they were good at all. I also ordered the French Fried Cheese, which were like mozzarella sticks but with Wisconsin cheddar. They were warm-ish and the cheese wasn't melty at all. 
Overall, I wasn't impressed and I don't plan to return.
The food is good and a great selection of beer. Friendly staff. The inside atmosphere is like a lodge.
If your idea of 'comfort food' is overpriced, gummy, tasteless and fried carbs smothered in cheese and/or bacon, then by all means, help yourself to some diabetes in a bread bowl. I scoured the menu and couldn't find a damn thing that wasn't carb-based or slathered in meat or dairy. I'm not even vegan or vegetarian. I just don't like my food to sit like a rock at the bottom of my stomach for 6+ hours after I eat it.

I've never wanted to stick my finger down my throat so long after eating half an entree, so thanks for getting me to try new things, Buck & Badger.
My boyfriend's family and I were looking forward to trying this north woods themed restaurant and bar, as we are lovers of being up north and miss that feeling down here in Madison. I will say that this restaurant provided this ambiance and did it very tastefully. However, the food was severely lacking.

We all ordered burgers and were surprised to see that the burgers didn't come with french fries, instead they came with coleslaw. This would have been acceptable if the coleslaw was any good. But it had zero flavor and was a huge disappointment. Also my boyfriend's mother ordered french fries and they came out stone cold and soggy, pretty gross actually. She told the waiter and he brought out a fresh hot order of fries, but they were still soggy. Our burgers were cooked perfectly and very delicious however.

Service was decent, but nothing to write home about.
I only came here for drinks. Their specials are inexpensive and pretty good. Save your receipt and you can use it instead of paying cover charge to enter ivory.
Horrible!!!! It took an hour for us to get our food!! No apology for the server! We will never go back!
Great Food!! Outdoor seating right on State Street. Adorable Wait Staff ! Have the Cheese Curd Fritters! Rockin!!
Three friends and I were looking for a restaurant on State Street for dinner before a show at the Overture Center. One friend said he was really craving a burger, so when we came upon the Buck & Badger, we decided to give it a try. We figured if they were able to afford to be so close to the Capitol, they had to be pretty decent. Unfortunately, this was not the case.

We were seated right away and were served drinks pretty quickly, which seemed promising, although the specialty Jack Daniels cocktails two of us ordered came in disappointingly small glasses. But then after we ordered our food we waited. And waited and waited. It was at least a half an hour before our food arrived, so even though we had initially given ourselves well over an hour to eat before our show started, we felt rushed once we finally got our food.

The food itself was okay, but nothing that wowed us. I chose not to spend the extra $3 for a side because I thought the coleslaw that came with my sandwich would be good enough -- who seriously wants to spend $3 for a side order of fries? -- but the coleslaw  was absolutely tasteless. The menu describes it as "sweet mustard cole slaw" but it was basically wet cabbage. My chicken sandwich, while nice and hot, was also pretty bland. The sweet potato chip breading didn't have as much flavor as I'd anticipated, and they really skimped on the chipotle mayo. My friends enjoyed their burgers but didn't seem overly impressed, and the long wait certainly didn't help.

If I'd had a chance to read reviews before we went there, I don't think we would have gone in the first place knowing that we had a show to get to and others have experienced the same very long wait we did. Also, other reviewers mentioned that they received complimentary chocolate chip cookies. We didn't get any, so either they no longer do this, or they were forgotten since we had to flag down our waitress just to pay the bill so we could get to our show on time. Either way, this was a disappointing dining experience, and with so many other restaurants on State Street, I wouldn't bother with a second visit to the Buck & Badger.
Trivia tuesday!!! What a fun time testing our trivia skills, enjoy a couple of appetizers,  and beer. They have a good selection of beer on draft abd I believe have bottle beer too. Definitely support local wisconsin beer! 

Our bartender was super friendly, he even bring us cookies during trivia.
Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back!

I was devastated when the old Top Notch BBQ food truck got repossessed out from under pitmaster Jimmy Cole. Where else was I going to get my beloved #CincyPorkWich, a towering sandwich of tender, smoky pulled pork smothered in rich, sweet Cincinnati chili?

Well, this month Jimmy and Val finally opened a brick-and-mortar version of their beloved Top Notch truck in a killer location at Eastern & Serene, just off the 215 in the Doc Holliday's restaurant space previously occupied by Monstah Lobstah.

I'm pleased to report that those familiar flavors are back and you can once again taste the well-deserved winner of the Las Vegas Weekly's nod as best BBQ in town.

I'm more than a little obsessed with the Cincy chili here, partly because you can only get it in one other place in Vegas (and they make it way too sweet). So my favorite sandwiches here are the ones smothered in it. The first is the aforementioned #CincyPorkWich, referred to on the menu unobtrusively as the "pulled pork sandwich." You can also get it with cole slaw instead of the chili, which is always a good option.

Another standout sandwich is the beef hot link, with genuine heat and a nice snap to it. It's served in a soft sesame seed bun, covered in just enough chili and melted cheddar to create a gestalt of savory goodness without rendering the sandwich a sloppy mess.

As for the sides, the beans are among the best I've ever had, and the sweet potato casserole is a standout as well.

In a desperate and futile attempt to battle the body image issues that come with being a single man living in Las Vegas, I try to restrict my diet with a "no pork during pool season" edict. When I break this edict, you can bet your pig's feet that this is where you'll find me.
Just follow your nose to this place! The smell of barbeque is wafting in the air from the parking lot since their smoker is out in front smokin up some ribs. The menu selection is simple but full of delicious homestyle comfort food choices. So I chose the two meat combo plate with choice of two side dishes (mine were Cincy style fries & Sweet Potato Casserole)  and Texas toast. I was in for a real treat!
 
Ribs and Pulled Pork -  Excellent!! This is way the ribs are done!  Sweet, Smoky and just a kick of Spicy! The seasonings they use for their dry rub are flavorful, you do not really need much sauce for it. That's a pet peeve of mine; when BBQ places drown their ribs or pulled pork with sauce. So I love how they use BBQ sauce here as a compliment for the ribs.  Smoked just right. Meat tears away from the bone easily.  Same deal with the pulled pork. One bite and I am forever hooked to Top Notch Barbeque for sure! The 2 meat combo plate came with 2 ribs and a huge portion of pulled pork. Mr. B ordered the smaller combo (yeah I know make me look like the piggy!)  It was $14.99 for 1lb of pulled pork 2 sides and Texas toast. A very good deal for the portions you get. This place beats out the chain BBQ places in every way.
  
Cincinnati Style Chili Fries - This is good stuff!  The fries are the thicker cut type topped with Chili and cheese.  Cincy style chili beef is finely grounded so the texture is not as chunky, it's almost like a meat sauce. The blend of spices are more on the sweeter rather than the spicy side, I tasted the cinnamon right away. For a side dish served with the combo the serving was plentiful.

Sweet Potato Casserole - It's OMGoody goodness!  Came as one of my other side dish choices. The whipped sweet potatoes were pack full in a mini bowl and topped brown sugar candied pecans. If you have a sweet tooth like me, you'll love this side dish. It's not over the top sweet, but this dish can also pass as desert in my opinion. In fact I did order an extra side to take home and will have it for my dessert. It was just that good!

The restaurant is part of Doc Hollidays but there is a separate entrance and it's divided from the bar/gaming part so families with younger children are welcome here.  The dining area is large, pretty light and airy, the walls have western motif deco going on.  Plenty of seating. Couple of booths against the walls and table/chairs that can be easily arrange to seat large groups.  Service was good! Our server Tommy  friendly and attentive, greeted us as soon as we stepped in, had our drinks out to us right away, took and got our orders promptly, refilled drinks when needed.  The  owner and THE Pit Master himself Jimmy also came to our table to check up on us as well.   Top Notch Barbeque lives up to it's name. Looks like I found my first lunch spot for 2013! I cant wait to come back here again and again.
Fantastic BBQ place. Went back to back days last weekend. My wife is a Cinci native and she was excited to see a place that has Cinci Chili. That's what got us in the door, but the amazing ribs, tender chicken, and insanely good sweet potato casserole is what will keep us coming back. Support this place. Henderson needs good BBQ like this.
Top Notch is by far the best barbeque that you will find here in Vegas or anywhere else for that matter, coming from two people who have lived and eaten all over the country and overseas.  We were followers of Top Notch when it was a food truck, devastated when they lost the lease on their mobile kitchen.  FINALLY the brick and mortar is here and everything is just as we remembered.

You can't go wrong with the green beans, sweet potato casserole, or baked beans with any one of the amazing proteins that are slow smoked to perfection on location.  By far, my favorite thing about Top Notch has always been the pulled pork, my boyfriend loves the chicken and ribs.  Whenever he orders the ribs, they get a little bit difficult to eat because you end up with a bone in your hand when gravity causes the meat to slide right off the bone.  This is NOT the kind of barbeque that you smother in sauce.  The house barbeque sauce, though, is a great addition, with a nice smoky pepper flavor, not too sweet like the syrupy sauce you find at chains, and not overly spicy like the stuff you find at BWW's or a wing joint.

Last but not least, make sure you ask for some of the sweet potato pie.  You'll most likely have to get it to-go, however, since you will have cleaned your plate for dinner!
Read about this new BBQ place in town on VegasChatter.com so went to check it out for lunch. The pulled pork sandwich was delicious and the best part of our experience here. I would recommend it. I ordered the chili on the side instead of on top of my sandwich. Good call because I didn't like the chili at all. Everything else we ordered was mediocre. Rib tips weren't very tasty. The sides were a disappointment and here's why - melted styrofoam! Gross! I dumped the baked mac and cheese onto my plate to find the styrofoam cup was melted on the inside! That CAN'T be healthy! Same happened with the sweet potato casserole. Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick. The baked beans also came in a styrofoam cup which didn't melt and tasted just ok. I know this place's roots are from a food truck, but it's time to get rid of the styrofoam! It's literally IN my food AND not earth-friendly. And you don't even need the styrofoam! The sides could be placed directly on the plate. Texas toast would be better if they buttered and seasoned BOTH sides of the bread. Fun to see Kool-Aid on the beverage menu and the smoker right out front! I truly hope they do well and work out the kinks because it has much potential!
Casual atmosphere in the space formerly known as Monstah Lobstah. Decent menu with interesting choices. 

We had a rack of ribs and a hot link sandwich. 

The hot link was great, but was served on a hotdog bun which disintegrated shortly after being served.  

The ribs.  The ribs are where it's at. Coated with a tasty dry rub and served naked. Great ribs ALWAYS taste good naked, and these were no exception. The sauce is an excellent blend of sweet and spicy and complimented the rub nicely.  Together, they made the ribs some the best we have had. 

We will be back!
First time around and I thought they were good. For a local BBQ joint, they might eventually move up to be one of my favorites. I didn't get to try their ribs because they were still cooking on the smoker. A tip would be to not go too early since they won't always have everything done by opening. I will go back sometime during the mid afternoon to guarantee me a taste of the highly spoken about ribs. 

What we did have was amazing. The chili cheese fries are everything you loved as a kid. The chili is free of beans and is made completely of meat. The cheese comes in sauce form. The fries could have been fried longer to add a textural variation to the dish, but that is just nitpicking. The two meat plate is more than enough to feed two people. The pulled pork was a little dry. I was highly impressed with the chicken. It was moist, tender, and the skin had a slight crisp under the BBQ sauce. As for the sides, the sweet potato casserole was the hands down best. It is packed with pecans and brown sugar goodness. The mac'n cheese was good as well. 

I will definitely be back for the ribs and sweet potato casserole next time.
I really wanted to like this place. I really did. 

I ordered the two meat combo. It is your choice of two meats and two sides. Comes with Texas toast. I chose pulled pork and ribs for the meat. Cincinnati Fries and Sweet Potato Casserole for the sides. 

The ribs had a dry rub on there that was decent. The pulled pork was tender but had no flavor. I poured the default barbeque sauce that was on the table. The sauce itself was a little bland but at least when you put it on the pulled pork it gave it some life.

The Cincinnati Fries were basically Chili Cheese Fries. The Chili itself is not what im used to. It was a bit runny and not spicy at all. The Sweet Potato Casserole was decent. It was pretty sweet and was topped with pecans.

The total I paid was 24.17 and that's with tax and 20 percent tip. Now as you can see that is bit pricey for the meal I had. Imagine if I got a fountain drink. That would have bumped it to 27 bucks. Their menu is the same no matter lunch or dinner. It would be awesome if they had lunch specials. 

Their location is a bit of find because they share the same building as Doc Holidays. I gotta admit, it is pretty spacious and clean. The service was decent.

Some random info: They play Blues music here. Nothing against it but the whole time I was there, the 6 or 7 songs I heard were all about growing up in the South and people finding the love of their life then breaking up which inspired the song they are singing. The songs I heard were different variations of the same thing. On February 2 they are gonna start a Karaoke thing. I guess that would be better than listening to depressing songs about your spouse and your dog running away. I guess people singing out of tune is more entertaining.

So overall, I wasnt too impressed. I don't usually wanna spend 20 plus dollars for lunch. I hate to say it but having eaten here is definitely gonna make me do that Dickey's Barbeque review. I think their barbeque sauce is what makes their beef brisket and pulled pork even better. AND you dont spend more than 20 bucks for one person.
Finally, a solid BBQ place that's not a chain and is closer to our house.  Got Top Notch to go for the Super Bowl at home.  It now occupies the space formerly held by Monstah Lobstah, which is the restaurant portion of the Doc Holliday's bar on the corner of Serene and Eastern.  Top Notch's sit doesn't make that clear, but the entrance is at Doc Holliday's.

My wife had chicken with green beans and baked beans.  I got the sampler platter, which I did not realize when ordering, but it's ENORMOUS.  4 meats:  ribs, chicken, hot links, and pulled pork.  Comes with 2 sides and 4 half slices (so 2 large slices) of texas toast.  This meal is easily enough for 2 people, and probably 3.  So, don't balk at the price (it's about $23 as I recall).  Well worth it, and you'll have leftovers for sure...

First thing, the texas toast has excellent garlic butter on it.  Not your typical toast.  I usually don't care for texas toast, as I find it too think and bready, but this had excellent flavor.  The ribs were the star meat-wise.  They had a nice smoke ring, good amount of rub, and were tender but not so tender they couldn't stay on the bone.  This is not as easy to achieve as many think.  The hot links were standard, I could have used more heat and I also like them crispier.  I'll ask that they stay on the grill longer next time I come.  The chicken was the worst of the 4 meats for me, but it was fine.  The mac n cheese was a great side, great crust on the top.  The sweet potato casserole is solid, but it's a dessert to me.  I'll definitely get it again.  The baked beans were my favorite of the 2 bean sides.  They have large pieces of meat in them and great classic BBQ flavor.  

I found the sauce to be fine, but I asked for hot and was given 4 deals of mild.  So, next time I'll make sure I get the hot sauce.

We'll be back for sure, it was a lot of food.  We will get several meals out of it.  Also, the meat stood up well to reheating in a toaster oven.

I was disappointed to find several items on the menu that were not listed on the website.  These items included mac n cheese, pulled pork, seasoned fries, plus many others.  So, realize this if you are ordering to go and going solely off of the website.  I grabbed a couple of to go menus, so we won't have the issue again.  I was told they will update the website, so I'm hopeful that occurs soon.
Top Notch indeed. My friend Jay F. had been talking up this place for years, dating back to when they were a food truck, so I couldn't pass up the chance to try it out. Pulled pork sandwich smothered with Cincy Chili? Yes please!

Located adjacent to a bar, this has the typical BBQ joint "no frills" look and feel. My friend and I settled on splitting two sandwiches - the pulled pork and sausage link, both covered in Cincy chili. Cincinnati chili is a different style (and IMO, superior style) than Texas chili. Don't expect a lot of heat ... instead spices like cinnamon round out the flavor profile. I prefer my Cincy a bit on the sweeter and spicier side, but this was good chili, and complimented the pulled pork and sausage link well. The chili cheese fries side were awesome, and came at no extra charge. (99% of places offer fries as a side, and an upcharge to add the cheese and chili) Beans were good, but overshadowed by the awesomeness of the chili cheese fries.

We also ordered rib tips, but they were conspicuously absent from the meal. We checked with the server, who indicated that they were missed, and would be out soon. They were, and we were "hooked up" with a massive order. Being stuffed from the sandwiches and fries, we had room for about 2 rib tips each and then took them to go. They were wonderful, smoky, tender, and great then and as leftovers 3 hours later. 

Top Notch is another great example of the quality food you can find in Vegas when you know someone who is a local and you get off of The Strip and other touristy areas. It's a legit destination for any BBQ aficionado.
Go for the 3 meat plate. Perfect for 2 people and the sweet potato pie should be renamed little slice of heaven.
Got the pulled pork with potato salad. The pulled pork is beautifully cooked and the potato salad is sweet and creamy. They have brisket now that I definitely will try next time. I will be back. Definitelty recommend.
This is great barbeque at a reasonable price. I had lunch there with my boss and he was raving about the pulled pork sandwich. I had the rib tip dinner with the sweet potatoe casserole and mac and cheese. The ribs were outstanding, tender and with the sides more than I can eat. That never happens and even with that I was so tempted to order another side order of the sweet potatoe casserole because it was just that good. I finished it for dinner and wanted more!! If you get the chance get there. It is not fancy but you will not care.. I was going to give 4 stars but in thinking about the food it was just that good!
Ok, so let me preface this by saying if this were based solely on the food, I'd probably give it three stars.  My issue is customer service.  Let me also preface this by saying that I'm a Sommelier & Manager in a restaurant.  I've also been a server and bartender, so I understand the inner-workings of restaurants. 

Sometimes things go wrong with just one customer when everyone else that day had a positive experience.  I also understand that it's not always the server's fault when things go wrong, in fact most of the time it's not, but yet most people take out their dissatisfaction on them.  The server who I dealt with was very polite and tried to accommodate me within what was probably the limits that management allows.   

I arrived to placed a to-go order.  I placed my order, paid, then sat down to wait.  About five minutes later she comes over to let me know they were out of what I ordered. Not her fault! I'm calm and choose something else.  I ordered the two-meat combo: hot links & ribs with mac'n'cheese and sweet potato casserole for my side, and this cookie thing for desert.  

Because they had to re-do my order, she told me it  would take a little longer and offered me a soft drink.   Again, she was very polite and attempted to make sure I would not be upset.  At one point she comes over to let me know they are packaging it up now, it will just be a few minutes...which wound up being fifteen minutes later.   Total time waiting: FIFTY minutes...that is fifty, FIVE-ZERO, 50.  The restaurant was not busy.  

She apologized profusely and offered me 10% off if I were to come back.  I was not nasty to her at any point as I know it was probably not her fault. But 10%?!?!?!  Are you kidding me?  If I hadn't already paid, I would have walked out.  No offer to refund my money or throw anything extra in(which they should have done automatically).  

Again, I'm a manager in a restaurant, but one who is empathetic and sympathetic.  I rarely get mad at poor dining experiences, but this was ridiculous.  Her manager should have offered me a FREE meal, not 10% off.  That's not the way you get someone to come back after an experience like that.  We comp a dish off a ticket or send free items when stuff like that happens and NOBODY HAS TO COMPLAIN.  If we know this happened, we automatically do this.   

On to the food and I promise this unbiased.  I believe reviews of food should be separate of everything else:
$27.99 for my entree and a dessert.  WAYYY TOO EXPENSIVE. 
The food was decent, ribs were tender and tasted pretty good, hotlinks were generic tasting, mac was ok, but the stand-out was the Sweet Potato casserole; it was amazing.  The dessert was good.  
Honestly, again being unbiased, you can get the same quality from Famous Dave's for way less money.  I lived in Memphis for three years and I'm picky about BBQ.  Still, it was decent, but totally not worth the price.
First off, let me just say that this is the best BBQ spot in Vegas....hands down. Let me first start off with the Kool-Aid...yes I said it, Kool-Aid. It was perfectly made with the perfect amount of sugar so it wasn't too sweet. The ribs were amazing and cooked perfectly. Even the gristle was soft and tender. The ribs are served with a dry rub that has just the right amount of kick, and there's sauce readily available at the table. The baked Mac & Cheese was awesome, and the the fries were seasoned perfectly. I was a huge advocate of Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ, but Top Notch kills them in almost every aspect. I highly recommend this place so come out and support!!!
First of all, it's not a real, "restaurant" it's really a make shift spot with tables located inside Doc Holiday's.  We came to this place after hearing amazing reviews from a magazine, boy were we surprised.  We wanted to order ribs but, "Sorry, we don't have any."  What!?  You are a Barbeque restaurant.  I ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and it came out PINK...PINK as in undercooked and totally overpriced.  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Then to top things off they brought us beer that was frozen solid.  If I wanted a Slurpee I'd go to 7/11.  Do NOT eat here.
Finally a GREAT barbecue place that we will frequent.  We split the 4 meat combo with ribs, pulled pork, spicy links and chicken. It came with two sides and Texas toast.  Everything was so very tasty.  The fries were crispy tossed in a really great spicy, sweet seasoning. There was plenty on that plate for us to split. The spicy link was our favorite. The spicy part did not linger for long in your mouth.  The owner stopped by our table to say hello and you can tell he genuinely loves what he does.  Try this place out!
What a fantastic place. If your tired of chain BBQ and places claiming to BBQ, then this is what Vegas sorely needed. This place is a hidden gem. Luckily I found out about it because of Yelp. The menu is the right size. Not so huge and just gets down to the good stuff. A tad pricey but worth it. It's price is similar to Lucille's but the taste and quality blows them away. I ordered the 2 meat combo. I went with the Ribs and Pulled Pork. You get 2 sides and garlic bread. I chose the baked Mac and Cheese and Seasoned Fries. You get 2 meaty Ribs. Seasoned to perfection and fall off the bone tender. Flamed kissed and comes with no sauce. You can add sauce since its on the table. It was smoky and juicy. I found myself nibbling all i can off the bone. I added some sauce to see what it would taste like. AWESOME!!! You can't go wrong going dry or sauced. I might be getting the whole rack next time lol. The pulled pork was outstanding. Where places in Vegas, its comes out dry. This didn't. It was juicy, smoked perfectly with a nice smoke ring on the meat. The rub they used was outstanding. You don't need sauce on it. If you do, also a home run. The perfect blend of sweet and tangy and a little subtle heat. I need to find out if you can buy the sauce. The Mac and Cheese blew me away. So rich and decadent. Cheese galore in this bad boy. This is a must have to try. I could eat this everyday. The cheese blend was incredible. I never had Mac and Cheese like this. The fries were crispy and had a great seasoning. The fries weren't greasy at all. It went perfect with ketchup as well as the BBQ sauce. When all you have is chains like Famous Dave's and Lucille's and Memphis Championship, this is a welcome addition. No chain backing this. Just a guy who knows how to BBQ and sharing his passion with us. It's funny seeing the negative nelly's on yelp always trying to act big and bad and hoping to get compliments. I take my food and dining experience very serious and always tell it like it is. So, don't listen to what these negative people trying to ruin someones business. Give it a try, i bet you won't be disappointed. Awesome job Top Notch Barbecue!! Till next time....Let's Eat!!!
unfortunately, I was a bit underwhelmed.  I love BBQ and I really wanted this place to rock, being that it's local and close to home.  I had the pulled pork, and it was ok.  the sauce got watery and made the bun soggy on the bottom.  I don't know if that was from the coleslaw or what?  It was also a bit pricey.  I don't think I would repeat.  The service was good, but I was really the only one there for lunch.
I came here the other day for an early dinner with my daughter, who heard about this place from Bread and Butter. We shared the 4 meat platter w/ 2 sides- links , ribs, pulled pork and brisket. Mac and cheese and baked beans for sides were also delicious. To  keep it short, this was the best BBQ I've had since the Salt Lick closed. Everything was delicious, flavorful and moist. The brisket was thin sliced, delicious and moist. Ribs smoked, spiced with  no sauce. The sauce is on the side and awesome. Big pile of pulled pork, and plenty of slices of hot links. There was enough to take home and reheat on the grill for the next day. It tasted just as good. Service was quick and attentive. But again, the food was super delicious. Forget the rest of the BBQ places in town, this is it! Good Luck.
What can I say about Top Notch Barbeque??

You see the rating, I'm a fan.  But I am usually a fan of anything BBQ. I've had this one bookmarked as soon as I saw that this was opened for business.  I knew that I would eventually hit this place up once Lent was over.  Well, Lent was over and now had three BBQ spots bookmarked;  Top Notch, TC Rib Crib, and Rollin Smoke.  I hear that all are pretty good so it really didn't matter which one I was going to hit first. 

Let's start with the bad;
1.  Smoke:  Not what you think, this isn't a restaurant where people smoke.  But the place stinks of cigarettes. I am assuming the previous business was a pub or bar.  If you can get past this, then you're ready for issue number 2.

2.  Price:  I thought that the prices here were a little high for what you get.  Over $25 for a three item combo??? At Famous Dave's, you can get a two item combo for less than  $10.

3.  Selection:  Menu is a small one pager.  Selection isn't huge. 

Now for the good:
1.  Taste:  I had their Beef Brisket Sandwich which was so good. This sandwich basically melted in my mouth. All I could think of was that their ribs must be good too. I'm assuming just from the tenderness of the briskets that their ribs are literally "fall off the bone" type.  I also had their Cincinnati Chili Cheese Fries.  My goodness, was this so bad for you, but good for me.  There's a slight sweet taste from the ginger they add to the chili. Both my meals were great and if it's just taste that I'm rating, I'd give them a solid 4.5 stars.  My only issues with the food was the size of the sandwich.  For over $10, I felt that this was a big small.  

Overall, it's the taste of the food that keeps me from rating Top Notch below 4 stars.  Price is a little heavy in my opinion.  But if you're looking for BBQ that's not a chain, then Top Notch should be on your radar.

This place feels to be trying to find it's identity, it's place in our dining community. It's located inside a bar as a separated venue, but the prices are a good deal higher than usual bar food. Rustic wood booths and tables with paper towel roll and a mason jar holding utensils and a western motif, but they have good live jazz music performed on the weekends. They let you sample the food but you don't smell the meats smoking so I think it's prepared off site. While their product satisfies me the prices I pay are at the top end of the spectrum, so I could eat at other BBQ places for the same or less where they hit all the notes. The menu and selections of sides are small and the 2nd visit (a Thursday) they were out of a couple of them. I hope they are working on the concept and can improve the overall restaurant. I'm pulling for them since this town only knows BBQ from chain franchises; these folks know BBQ. But they have some competition here; GET TO IT!
Came here after hearing a lot about it's opening through Vegas Seven and LV Weekly magazines.  Brought my normal group of friends for a Sunday night dinner.

Our server was very friendly throughout the meal and kept refills going and split our group check without much hesitation.  Unfortunately, they were out of both ribs and brisket which I hear are their best items on the menu.  Thankfully I was in the mood for a pulled pork sandwich, so this did not affect me, but I know a few people in my party were disappointed.

The pulled pork was really good, very tender and did not come with sauce on the sandwich so you could use the bottle on the table for your own liking.  I got a side of mac & cheese (which was included) I knew it was good from the start because the cheese was baked in versus runny.

After our meal was complete the owner came out to speak with us and shake each one of our hands.  I thought this was a great touch and showed that he's not afraid to get to know his customers.

I honestly don't have the same cravings for this place as I do Road Kill Grill, however the location is a plus and I would visit this place over other chain places in the valley!
Barbeque in Las Vegas. A phrase that tends to be an oxymoron, unfortunately. Top Notch, however, gets it.

We ordered the four meat plate: double ribs, pulled pork and 1/2 chicken. It came with two sides. After careful consideration, we chose the mac and cheese and sweet potato casserole....and then added the baked beans and seasoned fries for good measure.

The ribs: gigantic, St. Louis style pork ribs. Ain't no sissy little baby backs in this establishment. No siree! (Forgive me...I get fired up about barbecue. Feel free to read this in a southern accent). They were perfect; juicy, succulent, a slightly crunchy bark from the dry rub. Add a little of the housemade sauce and you got yourself something so good, it'll make you wanna slap ya mama!

Since I just made a reference to it, lets talk about the sauce. Usually, I'm not a sauce man and scoff at those that use such a beautiful piece of roast beast as a vehicle for some overly sweet, sodium riddled pancake syrup. The meat here is good on its own, but the sauce really takes it to another level: a perfect balance of tang, sweet and much needed spice. A sauce of any kind is meant to enhance the overall flavor of the meat, not overpower it. This heavenly nectar does just that...and perfectly well. This is exactly what I mean when I say Top Notch "gets it".

On to the rest. The chicken was good...a nice bite of lean between the bites of unctuous fattiness. The pulled pork was ok. I should mention that I'm just not a huge fan of pulled pork in general. To me, it's always dry and more or less flavorless. No different here. My wife loved it though.

The sides, for the most part, were on point. The fries were fries. Nuff said. The mac and cheese was creamy, rich and scrumptious. No truffles or lobster or any other froo-froo you see these days...just good ol' fashioned orangy cheesy deliciousness. Baked beans were fantastic as well with huge hunks of smoked sausage and a welcome peppery flavor. The sweet potato casserole was pretty friggin badass, but a little too sweet for my tastes.

Service was friendly and homey. The decor was welcoming and vaguely familiar to the BBQ shacks of yore. 

Las Vegas, I'd like you to meet barbecue...Barbeque, Las Vegas. I think you guys are gonna get along great.
The sweet potato casserole is worth the trip alone.  Hubby and I had the 2 meat combo plates.  We loved the chili-cheese fries, the baked beans and even the mac and cheese.  Though the mac was a bit over done and couldn't hold up and the cheese was a bit separated, it had great flavor.  The fries needed to be more crispy to hold up to the chili and cheese, but they were still good. Spare ribs had a fantastic flavor from the rub on them and just their natural porkiness.  Chicken was good as well but the thigh was a bit dry, leg was not.  The pulled pork had too much bbq sauce flavor for my liking. I find it best when rubbed heavily, pulled not chopped and definitely not touched with bbq sauce in any way.  I will add some if the sauce is outstanding, but really pulled pork should be able to stand in its own.  Our service was excellent, we were taken care of very well.  I am happy this place is good so when we are craving good Q I don't always have to make it myself.
What a great BBQ place. Great ribs and pulled pork! They had great taste all by themselves and were not drowned in any sauce. The best sweet potatoe cassarole and chili cheese fries. Its worth the trip from the West side of town.
Cot Damn this was some good BBQ!!! Took a little while longer than expected to get my sides...the ONLY thing that I can complain about! I am officially done with Famous Daves
Found this place by accident. Monster Lobster used to be here, But what a nice accident. Great rib tips, marvelous cole slaw, my sister had the BB chicken which was moist and equally tasty, Chef/owner Jimmy Cole came out and talked with us. This place started as a corner booth, then a food truck and now this location. soon there will be a second location.

If you arfe a local or a visitor please frequent this restaurant, they need your support and have a GREAT product!!!!!!
Soggy Texas Toast.  Tough ribs.  Poured on BBQ sauce.  WAY overpriced.  I would pay these prices at Lucilles, but definitely not here.  Will not return.
Went here for a to go order. It took 35 minutes wait time. Beef brisket had way too much fat. Cole slaw, baked beans, and sweet potato casserole were very sweet for my taste. Pulled pork was a little sweet but good.  The green beans were good.  I ordered 2 dinners which totaled $41.  This is way out of line compared to other BBQ places in town.
Ended up just stumbling upon this place and thought we would give it a try.  We have already been back for more in just 48 hours!!!  Absolutely the best-hands down- we have found in town for sure!!!   The ribs are phenomenal, chicken superb!!!  Definitely well worth trying and I bet you will be hooked just like we are!!!  Don't miss the sweet potato side dish!!!
Really good homemade food!!!  Stick to your ribs food.  BBQ.  Mac n Cheese the best. I have had chicken, ribs, and brisket all great. Several sides to choose from, all are tasty. Wait staff friendly and efficient. Live music at times.
Was jonesing for some BBQ for dinner tonight.  I was about to go to Ellis Island Casino Brewery for some of their BBQ, which is another hidden gem right off the strip, but I decided to check for one around the neighborhood.  I'm glad I did.  

Got a 2 meat dinner with 2 sides and garlic texas toast.  The meat from the ribs, just fall right off the bone.  I eat alot a chicken, so I decided to get the hot links instead of my usual poultry.  Awesome.  You don't even need BBQ sauce to eat this stuff, their dry rub must be off the hook.

As for the first side, I got coleslaw which was refreshing and light. Not too sour and not too sweet. My second side was the sweet potato casserole, which could actually do double duty as a dessert.  

Everything complimented each other goooood.  These guys must be Pinoy at heart, you got the spicy, hot, and sweet all mixed together.

Negatives - no rice...haha, but I ususally don't eat much of it these days...
This place is really good. It's locally owned and can definitely see the vision for it. I hope it succeeds and continues to grow.

The food is great when it's great, but sometimes it misses the mark, but that has more to do with my personal expectations than the actual flavors -- they need to provide their customers with more guidance. I've been here twice now, and tried to diversify what I ordered so that I can get a better sampling of the menu. The one thing I can say is this place is most enjoyed when ordering family style.

Here are some highlights:
- The Ribs were to die for. Seasoned and perfectly smoked, you can tell that this was a labor of love. The meat falls off the bone and comes in pretty big portions.
- Sweet Potato Casserole is by far the best side on the menu. Although as a warning, it is listed a side but is really a great dessert, so if you get it make sure you get another side, maybe the fries, which make a nice accompaniment to the ribs.
- Hot Links are better than Famous Dave's. The first time I ordered them I was hesitant and didn't enjoy them that much, but this time around I ate them with Texas Toast and I must say they are good.
- Grape Kool-aid was bomb.com

Some not-so-highlights:
- Chili tastes like curry. So when I ordered them I was surprised to eat what tasted like curry-fries. Shockingly British. But I hear that's how they do it in Cincinnati.
- The Pulled pork can be dry. 
- Macaroni and Cheese is ok. I'm personally not a fan because I don't like nacho cheese, but that's just me.

My one true wish, aside from world peace:
- I wish they had corn bread. I really do. Adding that to the menu would make me happy.

Overall the place itself is nice, I think they need help with their branding. Their menu could use some revamping -- even after having already visited once, it was still difficult to navigate and order for a group. Our server Suzette was great and she really helped bring some order to the chaos. Definitely ask for her if you go :)
Where do I begin?
Went on a Monday at 1230...husband ordered brisket...but they were out? Really....already...at 1230...did you just not cook one? Then he tried to order a half chicken...waitress told him it really wasn't a half chicken it was just legs and thighs to equal a half chicken...what???
I ordered a 2 meat combo...pulled pork and hot link. Now I will give credit where credit is due....the meat and flavor was good....the sauce was good too..had a little kick to it. Sides.....we had the chili cheese fries (share-able) and they were good...I had baked beans...nothing special but not bad at all....and we both had the potato salad....I felt it tasted like it was store bought :( and hubby had mac n cheese said it was ok....not bad not good.
I'd like to go back when they have brisket and I'd like to try the ribs next time....hopefully I can update with more stars!
Easily the best BBQ in town.  And I've tried all the places.  
Everything served with sauce on the side.  That's one way you know the meat you're getting is high quality - they don't cover up poorly cooked/sourced meat with a ton of sauce.  The meat and rub can stand on it's own.
The ribs are tender but not "falling off the bone" overcooked.  The hot links have a nice snap and fantastic flavor.
I'd say the brisket is the star of the show.  You can get decent ribs and hot links at other places - but haven't seen a place in town that has good brisket.  And this brisket is GREAT.  My only quibble is they don't offer burnt ends - those are the salty, crispy, fatty ends of the brisket that are considered a black gold delicacy amongst bbq fans.  They throw them away.  It's absolutely loco.  
Sides are pretty decent but I judge a bbq place on it's meat.  And the meat here is....wait for it......top notch.
I've been wanting to try Top Notch for a while, especially since it's a favorite of Shirley B.'s--that's all I needed to know, but it's also located in the same shopping plaza as my hairdresser - convenient!  So, after getting my hair did after work one night, I planned  a double date dinner with the b/f and two of my great friends here-all I had to do was walk next door.  For a Thursday night at 7:00pm, the place was deserted, which is surprising since the food and service is, yes, top notch.  I ordered the two-item combo: ribs and pulled pork with the mac n cheese and highly rated sweet potato casserole for my two sides.  The dinner also came with two pieces of Texas toast.  It was a heck of a lot of meat and what usually happens when I have BBQ happened again:  I ate up all the sides and had lots of BBQ left over.  The mac n cheese was great (I love the stuff too much) and the sweet potato casserole lives up to the hype.  The ribs are not the fall-off-the-bone type, which I prefer, but they were still tasty and the pulled pork was flavorful, as well.  Our server was friendly and attentive, but not hard to do when there really weren't too many customers in there.  That's a shame, though, because this place is legit.  Give it a try--Tita Shirley was right again!
Definitely the best BBQ I've had in a while!!
Being from the south, I have been missing the taste of down-home cooking.  Top Notch is incredible!! I can't wait for my family to visit. I've had the rib tips, mac and cheese, baked beans, and pulled pork nachos. Everything was delicious, and the meat is soo tender!! The mac and cheese is amazingII The BBQ sauce is also amazing! I love this place!! I hope Top Notch continues to grow!!
No better ribs in town. Without a doubt! Add a side of their unique sweet potato casserole, and you have a plateful of sheer heaven. 

Have I mentioned the ribs?

While everything they serve is (forgive me) top notch, it's the ribs that will keep you coming back. They do them old-school here, slow-cooked with a dry rub that renders the ribs so unbelievably tender & flavorful that you won't be able to stop until your plate is nothing but a pile of bones.

Back to the sweet potato casserole. Served hot, it makes a great side-dish for the fall-off-the-bone ribs. But here's a hint: take one home and put it in the fridge. Overnight, it will magically turn into dessert! That's how crazy-good this stuff is.
Love Ribs!!! I checked this place out after the local mag gave top notch raving reviews and they were spot on amazing dry rub big meat falling off bone spare ribs. Caught the vegas rib-jones here, but after two big-time satisfying visits with my fam, the third and last time was so sad. Ribs were 3rd rate bad and mostly fat. I told our sweet waitress the score and she said the next time we come in (the next time???) they would comp us a half rack plate. She even admitted her mother had the same experience of third rate fatty ribs. So now sadly my search for great vegas ribs continues elsewhere. Note to Top Notch Rib Man- Do NOT compromise or you will lose more customers
Went based on the rave reviews of the food today sunday 6/16 at 2pm. Walked in and sat ourselves as the sign stated. at no point for the 15 minutes we sat there were we ever greeted, acknowledged, nothing. A server who was just moving things around in the drink station walked by us three separate times once to bring water to the table next to us and we never received so much as eye contact. We noticed with two servers and about 10 tables with patrons there were at least two other tables that were never acknowledged while we were there. I don't mind waiting but don't ignore us well take our business elsewhere, won't return and will tell others of our experience.
Pretty good bbq place. The ribs were darn good. My friend didn't even add bbq sauce to hers. 

The green beans are pretty good, made with turkey thigh. Mac and cheese was delicious! How can you go wrong with Mac and Cheese though? Super good. 

I ordered the brisket dinner and it was quite yummy. I used a ton of bbq sauce, because I like a little brisket with my sauce.  I tried the spicy bbq sauce (you have to ask for it), but it was a little too spicy for me. 

Cole slaw was pretty good, but I didn't like Cincinnati Chili fries. I mean the fries were ok, but the chili was not for me. Blah

Overall pretty good meal. Kind of expensive at about $18 per meal. But I think it's about the same at most bbq places.
Best BBQ I've ever had meat falls off bones side dishes are great sweet potatoes. Baked beans with sausage chili cheese frys Mac and cheese better than I've had in any restaurant customer service was great very friendly and attentive will be back
Very good BBQ, without a doubt.  The food was more than plentiful and was absolutely delicious.  Top Notch solidly earned the 4-star rating that I'm giving them, but there are some things that I'd prefer to see to get that extra star.

We decided to try Top Notch because I wanted to treat the wife to a good barbeque meal (she's a Kansas City girl who loves her barbeque!) and we had a Groupon voucher that gave us some incentive to try something new.  We were not disappointed.

First, we had some difficulty locating the restaurant.  I'd mapped it to the Eastern / Serene intersection, but forgotten to write down the _exact_ address - after all, how hard could it be to find a barbeque place on one of the corners of the intersection?  Well, it was harder than we expected, because the only sign for it was a printed banner that sat well below the "Doc Holliday's" sign on the building - we kept seeing the "Doc Holliday's" sign and missing the "Top Notch Barbeque" sign!

So, having found the restaurant, we got in to the restaurant and chose our seats - it's a seat-yourself place.  We looked over the menu for a while, decided on what we wanted, and started to place our order.  That's when the server, Ashley, let us know a few things.  First, the dinners are "better" than a la carte, because you get 2 sides for the price of 1 and you get Texas toast (don't order separate Texas toast unless you're _really_ hankering for it).  Next, the burgers are so large that they take "about 20 minutes" to cook, which may explain some other reviews' complaints about waiting or their meals to be served.  Finally, alcohol is served from "next door", so it's billed separately - Grouponers should note that alcohol will _NOT_ be covered with the voucher.

So, after deciding and then waiting for a very short 5 minutes to be served, I had the brisket dinner, which turned out to be a full pound of meat and actually lasted for 2 entire meals.  The brisket was fork tender and chock full of authentic BBQ flavor, and I even forgot to use any BBQ sauce until I was nearly done.  I got the green beans and the baked mac and cheese as dinner sides, and both were far better than I expected them to be.  The Texas Toast was pretty alright, as well.

The wife got herself a half rack of ribs dinner plate.  Yup, at another pound of meat, that was WAAAAY more than she could handle.  She loved the ribs, and ate until she couldn't get any more of that savory goodness down - she ended up eating 2 of the 6 very large ribs at the table, and then brought the rest home - our dog just LOVED the rib bones, too!  The wife did manage to finish most of her side of green beans, but couldn't eat the side of potato salad because it was "sweetened" potato salad (not to be confused with potato salad made using sweet potatoes).  Note, we strongly prefer the mustard-y, non-sweet traditional way to make potato salad, and this failed our "principle of least surprise" test - there should be a warning on potato salad that's sweet...

The dining experience itself was really nothing to write home about, so don't go for the ambiance.  The place was not really busy, with only about 1/4th of the tables occupied - this was a Friday 7pm time slot.  The decor was very lower-end average, maybe just a bit too rustic, particularly considering the prices - I would have expected for a $50 ticket for 2 people that the decor would be on par with the other restaurants in the same price range.  The service throughout the meal was decent, but not 5-star.  Our server, Ashley, was very, very pleasant - she even loaned us her smart phone to be able to claim our Groupon voucher when my own phone didn't work!

So, the upsides are:
1.  Great, great, great barbeque meats that are cooked to perfection
2.  Amazingly large portions
3.  Good sides, with the exception of the potato salad
4.  Warm and friendly staff, particularly Ashley who was just great!
5.  Decent location
6.  Groupon voucher can incent you to try it - but make sure to tip appropriately!

The downsides (what keeps it from a 5-star rating for me) are:
1.  Poor signage kept us searching for the restaurant for far too long
2.  "Sweetened" potato salad, with no option for the traditional style
3.  Meager decor, especially considering the area and prices
4.  Separate alcohol bill - we didn't imbibe, but were warned about it beforehand
5.  The website is pretty mediocre and the online menu just isn't complete, so we were left guessing until we had the actual menu in hand
6.  Apparently, there's supposed to be wifi, but someone forgot to pay the bill or something, which meant that it wasn't working when we visited

In total, I'd definitely eat there again.  Next time either of us is feeling the need for a barbeque fix, we'll be definitely head back to Top Notch.  Considering the price, it'll probably be a once a month regular stop for us, and one that we'll be looking forward to the rest of the month.
The name says it all. Possibly the finest BBQ in the valley.  Top Notch reminds me of some of the BBQ places i have been in KC and Texas. Not deluxe furnishings but drop dead awesome BBQ. The cooker is out back and they really BBQ the meat (as opposed to grilling.) Brisket takes over half a day. Owner/chef was nice enough to come out and talk with us. Great guy, great food. Had the rib tips and brisket. Meat was tender, juicy and lots of flavor. think i used a little sauce but not much because the meat didnt need to be smothered with some other flavor it was so good. If you want the tasty bread go to the "other place" but if you want incredible bbq meat, come to Top Notch. As a side note the texas toast is very good however not as good as the sweet biscuits cornbread you get at the "other places." But hey, the name is Top Notch Barbeque, not bread.
BEST BBQ in Las Vegas and VERY Family friendly!!!!  I highly recommend!
We were in Las Vegas on vacation and I came across a groupon for Top Notch barbecue, we had rented a car for the day and headed out there and we are glad we did, the brisket sandwiches were great and they gave us a sample of their award winning ribs, they were awesome, the rub that they have was great, no need to drown it in sauce, the sweet potato dish with the candied almonds was heavenly. Cole slaw too was excellent. If I lived there it would be on my favorites list.
3 of us ate lunch here for around $40 bucks. My girlfriend said the other day she has been dreaming of the BBQ since then. It was really good, Very tender. The ribs were done at noon and we got there at 12:15 so they were perfect. The sweet potatoes were the best side hands down. Mac and Cheese was yummie too. Beans were good, but did not blow me away. We had a half rack of ribs and a brisket a-la- cart. it was too much food for the 3 of us to eat. We will go back.
Bought a coupon from groupon and went to eat there only to find out they had no ribs or chicken only brisket. Terrible !!!!
Do not go there!!! :(
My first review of a restaurant I have never eaten at. After reading mostly good reviews, I had my heart set on nice smoky ribs. So we get there. The waitress says 'how many"...three was the response. "How would you like to sit here?". "Yes!" I said. We sit down, we get our menus. "What would you like to drink?" "We will stat with water". "Oh, by the way, we don't have any ribs or chicken"....cue sound of needle scratching across the record. You are a barbeque place...and you have essentially no barbeque. I am stunned. Bad enough you are kinda missing the only reason to go, you don't say this as soon as we walk in. You wait until you seat us, give us menus, take drink orders....oh yeah...no food. So, good luck small businessman, we will be over at Lucilles, where they have food.
Update 7/9/2013
So, tried again .Last time they said "call ahead to see if we have any ribs or chicken"---quite an unusual tactic, but, I did. And the result....called three times tonight and never got an answer. Each time the phone went to an answering machine. Yikes. So, off we go to see if this restaurant actually has food. Get there, stand at eh podium, and stand, and stand, and stand. Have I finally got a super-power and turned invisible? Maybe....but no, after a long time standing, I am seen. maybe my power wore off. OK, contact made, and lo and behold, ribs and chicken confirmed. So, we sit down and discover the super-power has returned, because we are surely invisible once again. Finally we order, and the amount of time it took for the food to arrive was absurd. If it wasn't so comical, I would have been angry. Thank goodness for games on my phone. But, there it is, food finally shows up. Me, I had ribs, bbq beans and the sweet potato casserole. And it was good, damn good. No complaints about the food at all. Delicious! One comment...there is a big smoker out front that I have never seen operating, and I am not sure these ribs were actually smoked. Usually you see the tell-tale smoke ring. Not on these. Still a great meal though. One more big hurdle...to pay, and yes, the waiting started all over. All in all, good food, abysmal service. To watch the people work, it looked like a disorganized mess---and they have been open several months. Just terrible. One hour 45 minutes beginning to end. HIRE SOMEONE TO MANAGE YOUR SERVICE, and you will have a good thing going. PS, they told me I had the last of the sweet potato side and as we left they were telling people arriving they were out of ribs...sigh.
Not worth it.
2 stars because the food was decent but that was the only decent thing about our visit today. The beans (baked and green) were hot, the meat (pulled pork, ribs and brisket) were tasty but after sitting around for who knows how long they arrived warm at best. Those were the positives now onto what needs improving. Service, hire another server. There was 1 for the whole restaurant and the bus person was almost useless. She looked at us numerous times before we finally had to ask for drinks and we were told they were out of straws when the table next to us received some after us. When I asked again someone had to tell her where they were. Then we waited and waited. The server was nice trying to appease saying 4 times we were next and the food is on it's way. We still waited. A table that arrived after us was served first, tempers were rising. Finally dinner was served but without 2 items we ordered. They were sold out and we had something else. Sorry to say we will not be returning.
Heard This was the new hot spot for "Q" and it didn't disappoint us in the slightest! Our waitress Liz was a complete Sweatheart! Very warm and friendly the whole time(Even when I changed our order after she put it in with  the cook) and made us both feel like we were eatin dinner at mom's house(But I wish mom coulda made Bbq even close to this caliber) :-) So we got the 4 meat combo platter with Brisket, chicken, pullef pork, and of course their famous RIBS! All the meat was so tender, juicy, flavorful, you name it! it had everything! And the sauce on the tables has the perfect spice, amazing with the Brisket! and the Cheesiest Mac & cheese of all time! My girl is a freak for beans of any kind, so for her to say this place has The BEST baked beans she's EVER had is like The Highest Honor Ever ;-) can't wait to come back! BEST BBQ IN LAS VEGAS HANDS DOWN. Even the owner came out to see how.everything was going! Just a great down home family joint!!!
Eat some delicious bbq at this casual, comfortable and well-priced restaurant. Their menu is simple, but what they serve is really great.The mouth watering dry rub on the tender ribs was so good, that it was difficult to put sauce on them. They offer the regular bbq fare.... and when they are out... they are out as a member of our party wanted chicken but there was none to be had! Couple of highlights... the sweet potato casserole was outstanding, whipped, baked and topped with nuts, as well as the mac and cheese and well flavored beans. Wait staff was friendly and checked back frequently to make sure we were happy!
After all of the high reviews, I figured it would be a good place to try out. As I was entering the restaurant, I stopped someone who was leaving with leftovers, that's a good sign. I asked how his experience was. He was less then enthusiastic about the food and service. That was not a good sign.

The sign says, "seat yourself." I looked for a good spot to sit and found a table near where other were seated. I found that it had food particles on it and a few napkins. One of the two only active waitresses came by and asked me to go sit on some waiting chairs. I waited while a waitress went to clean the table.

Once it was clean, she waved me over and I sat down. The seats are nice, no arms, and the temperature was quite cool on a hot Summer 100 degree plus day. Though I did smell cigarette smoke from the bar next door.

The waitress came by and asked to take my drink order. It was delivered in a fairly large cup, water usually comes by thimble size in restaurants these days, so that was nice.

Then it was time to order an entree. I opted for the Two Meat Combo for $18.99 which comes with two sides. I asked the waitress what were her most ordered sides. She said the sweet potato crumble and mac & cheese. So I ordered those along with a 1/4 chicken and ribs.

My previous experience with BBQ in Las Vegas stems from many visits to Ellis Island's BBQ and Famous Dave's. Both places serve large meals for good prices. So I was expecting more than what I received and after a pretty good wait.

For $18.99 I received two ribs and a quarter chicken plus the sides I mentioned above. The temperature of sides were adequate. The sweet potato crumble was initially delicious, after some time, it became too much for me to finish. The other person I went with ordered a potato salad, which was much better. The mac & cheese was tasty. The chicken and ribs should have been super hot. They were slightly warm to the touch, not what I was looking for. The person I went with also ordered the 1/4 chicken. It too was slightly warm, but not hot.

The person I went with got their 1/4 chicken and two sides for $10.99. How can they justify two ribs for an extra $8?

Our waitress was nice, the water tasted clean and the sides were good. The temperature needs to be turned up a lot on the meat served and I unfortunately ended up smelling like a cigarette.
My wife and I tried This place last night . We ordered the three piece meat platter Ribs,Pulled Pork,Hot links with two sides Mac n cheese , seasoned fries $20 . The waitress brought us two plates which was nice . We were super excited to try it ! Well after trying the ribs I was SOLD ! Yummy finally some good ribs in Vegas ! The pulled pork was great as well as the Hot links all had a great smokey flavor mmm mmm good . BBQ sauces are in squirt bottles regular is the one I loved and spicey which is hot try a dab first. The mac n cheese was super cheesy Loved it! and the fries were good also. We will definitely be going back to this joint . We walked out with full bellies and smiles on our faces for $25 ! Thank you Top Notch Barbeque !
The food here is terrible. Ribs have more fat than pork in every bite. The French fries were soggy, Luke warm, and tiny pieces that would find in the bottom of a frozen bag. The potato salad was not edible as the 2 potatoes in this side were not cooked in a heavy mayo-horseradish mush. Mac and cheese was way over cooked with sooty noodles with very little cheese. The sides here are tiny. $18.99 for the 6 fatty ribs with sides is way too much.
We had dinner here last night and left thinking our experience was several notches below the top.  Thoughts on food, beverage, service, etc.: 

-  Signage is a bit tough as it blends in with Doc Hollidays signage
-  Seat yourself and server only service model not effective
-  Windows need to be cleaned 
-  Ceiling fan on high and can't be shut off upon request
-  Tables leave and sit full of dirty dishes for long period of time
-  Out of brisket on a Saturday night
-  The meat platter and sides were good albeit all food served lukewarm 
-  It is odd that Texas toast was only toasted on one side
-  I found the decor kind of odd and inexpensive
-  Upon going to the counter to pay check server asked if I had info for my coupon . I never had a coupon?  Then I found out about some great deal I couldn't take advantage of.
-  Lastly, asked for toothpicks and server said they were out of toothpicks...I said really how do you run out of toothpicks..  She then went over to Docs and came back with a few.  

So, we either came on the worst Saturday night they have had since they opened or they have alot of work to do...me thinks it is the latter.  I would suggest changing service model so that it is more welcoming, tables are cleaned and food is delivered hot. There probably is enough space to bring in some live music and change decor to reflect that.  Or, go back to delivering the BBQ from a food truck.
This place is amazing! Way better than Rollin Smoke!! Portions are huge, excellent value!
Best BBQ in town! Liz, our server, was so nice! My friend and I shared the 3 meat combo (ribs, chicken and pulled pork), comes with 2 sides (we got Mac and cheese and sweet potato casserole and then decided to also add the green beans). Plenty of food for two, so full. The green beans were real southern style with pieces of turkey. Delicious. Loved the sweet potato casserole and Mac and cheese too. As for the meat...it just fell of the bone and you didn't even need the sauce with the pulled pork.
I have been wanting to try this place for a long time. I don't live on this side of town so it's taken a while. Well, I FINALLY made it and boy is worth a drive!! So good. So very good. My friend Melissa and i shared the three meat combo. We got the ribs, chicken and pulled pork. It comes with two sides and garlic Texas toast. We chose Mac n cheese and sweet potato casserole. But we also added the green beans because our lovely  server Liz said they were amazing when I asked about them. All three meats were delicious! Fall off the bone tender. I found myself wondering if ribs were allowed to fall apart like that! The BBQ sauce was good, but man, the meat was so tasty it didn't even need it! All the sides were fantastic! I could eat the sweet potato casserole for dessert but why not for dinner! Green beans were everything I wanted them to be! I'm kind of from Kentucky so I know what good southern green beans should taste like! Like grandma makes them of course! And boy they did not disappoint! All in all. Amazing. Must try! No matter how far away it may be. Now I just need to get my family to make the trip!
Excellent pulled pork sandwich! Doing BBQ right!
This was the first time we tried top notch bbq. We ordered it to go. We had the brisket, ribs., sweet potato casserole, Mac n cheese and coleslaw. The ribs were very fantastic!! Brisket was a tad on the dry side. The Mac n cheese was awesome! As was the sweet potato casserole and cole slaw. Service was good and the staff very friendly, the only criticism would be that they don't have it together as far as the menu goes. The menu on their website is very limited. Did not mention the brisket or Mac n cheese and had no prices. While we were waiting for our take out order we saw the waitress deliver a plate of pulled pork nachos that looked fantastic and were huge! We are gonna try those next time. We took a menu with us but they were not on the menu either!!
I got the $15 for $30 Groupon ... Overall the Meal was okay, and the Service was great. First, If you have never been to this joint the signage is BAD and it is easy to drive right past the restaurant because it shares space with the Doc Holliday's Saloon.  When you're coming into the restaurant you can smell cigarette smoke from the bar. Next, if you're a real BBQ Fan or your from one of the BBQ meccas you're going to want to lower you expectations or you're just setting yourself up for disappointment. This is a BBQ Joint that has some very good dished on the menu, unfortunately, those good dishes don't start with the BBQ. If you continue to read the entire review I will highlight my meals SUPER STARS and some dishes that failed to meet my standards. However, I think with a few tweaks the restaurant can be headed in a good direction and will be around for a long time. 
THE ORDER:
Appetizers...
Hot Wings and Onion Rings
Main Entree: Four Meat Combo with Two Sides...
Meats --- Hot Link, Pulled Pork, Pork Ribs, and Beef Brisket
Sides --- Green Beans, Sweet Potato Casserole
Service --- Really Really GOOD, If there was one more server or someone who worked the POS machine so that we, customers, could enjoy Liz's undivided attention it would have been Excellent. Liz is AWESOME, she's welcoming, very knowledgeable, and super friendly! She is the reason I gave the restaurant 3 stars instead of just 2. However, her attention was stretched to thin. At one point she had 7 tables and 2 carryout orders. If only P&G would hurry up and figure out the cloning technology, because another Liz would fix all of the service issue. OK, I'm all done with talking about my Liz Crush!
Appetizers...
Hot Wings---The wings where good. I would not be surprised to find a jar of opened Frank Buffalo Wing Sauce open in the kitchen. So I know you're thinking to yourself, "This person went to a BBQ Joint and ordered Hot Wings? Is she one of those people who would orders steak at a seafood place or bangers and mash at the Taco Tia!" NO! I'm not. However, there was not a lot of BBQ themed appetizers; and I LIKE Hot Wings. Don't judge me. 
The Onion Rings---OMG! They were EXCELLENT. If I should get married again, I want my future husband to propose to me with these onion rings. I can picture it now... Him on his knee longingly looking into my eyes as he pull out a basket of these onion ring from his inside coat pocket. At that moment I'd let a single tear falls as I whisper, "Yes!" TMI? Maybe a little; but you have your fantasies, let me have mine.
Main Entree ... Let's start with the sides and save the meaty bits until the end.
Side Dishes...
Green Beans---They were very good, cooked perfectly but a little to spicy for my taste. What I really loved about these Green Beans was the turkey bits... I Know, RIGHT! It's mind blowing. They opened up a BBQ Joint and do they put smoke pork in the Green Beans?? NO! They kick tradition in the balls and go with turkey. If liking these green beans are wrong I don't want to be right. 
Sweet Potato Casserole as I like to call it Sun-Shine in a cup. These were YUMMY! I LOVE Cinnamon in everything Coffee, Tea, Fruit Loops, etc. These for me had the prefect balance of sugar and spice and everything nice! OK seriously, If something is wrong in your life, I sure that eating this casserole will make it all better. 
Four Meat Combo...
Hot Links---One Word DELICIOUS. I can see these BBQ-ed Hot Links becoming a bad habit in my life. So when I hit bottom and you see me in one of the 12 step programs you'll know this is when it started. It's just going to be awkward having to 9th step Liz ... I'm sorry, did we cross over into TMI again?
The Brisket---OVERCOOKED ... It's like eating Sawdust that melts in your mouth [Yea, Let your brain chew on that statement for a minute] The fatty bits where moist and delicious because it is beef fat, it can't help but be delicious. However, the lean meat was tender, but no taste or flavor and very dry.
The Pork Ribs---OVERCOOKED ... I took one bite and all the meat came off the bone. I know you're think, "They says that's the sign of good BBQ ribs?" "They" lied to you! If you bit into a rib and all the meat comes off the rib is over cooked. So, any of that yummy porky goodness went up in smoke either in the smoker or in the warmer.
The Pulled Pork---I don't know what happen with the Pulled Pork it was just all wrong! It's going to take years of therapy to work through the issues I have with this pulled pork. However on a happy notes it was a good vehicle for the BBQ Sauce. You should know I'm not a big fan of sauce on my meats but I needed some lubrication to help chock down the pulled pork. The restaurant offered 2 different sauce 1 spice and 1 sweet. The sauces themselves are not really notable but they helped give some taste to the pulled pork.
This place is great!  Hands down the best in the area for quality and a great price point.  We tried a few of the mixed meat plates, great brisket and great bar-b-que sauce.  The sides were amazing - mac and cheese and cole slaw were my choices - basic but done well. It's often that basic sides like this are a mess - not here.  I do have to agree with those that mention the signage issue - bigger signs will make it easier to find.  We had to leave in a hurry and the staff was super friendly overall - we can't wait to return and enjoy again.
Food was 4 stars, BUT everything else was a 3. 3.5 stars option? Indeed. 
We went with a large group of 7, and there was only one booth we could all fit in, so we helped ourselves to it. I had Top Notch when it was a food truck and loved it, so I was stoked to eat it again. Right off the bat I noticed the table was sticky. Gross, but whatever. The sweet tea and koolaid will do that to a place. The service reminded me of what you'd receive in bar, not a family style bbq joint. It was not bad service at all. But did our waitress care? Probably not. 
On to the good stuff, THE GRUB! My niece who is 8, and probably couldn't finish one menu item alone, gave me an excuse to get the 4 meat combo plate. Of course to share with her. We ordered double ribs, brisket, and hot links with sides of mac & cheese, green beans, and cole slaw. Skip the cole slaw, everything else was BOMB.COM!! The brisket was tender, and amazing with the spicy sauce. The mac & cheese tasted home made. I tried my boyfriend's chili cheese fries and they were also to die for.  The green beans had small chunks of meat that gave them a great saltiness. I really liked it all and felt very satisfied by the end. 
I would return here in a heart beat and even consider bumping them up a star if they changed a few small things.
BBQ is my absolute favorite and I am more critical of BBQ joints than any other restaurant. I wasn't really excited to go to Top Notch because I figured it would be another over rated, mediocre place that I would never go to again.Wrong!!! If I didn't have leftovers from yesterday, I would be ready to go back again today. So why only four stars and not five?

The owner/manager really has to listen to others and get better service going in that place. We waited for 10 minutes before someone took our drink order. I usually NEVER wait that long. I'm glad I did, but dang...also...the manager needs to work with the kitchen staff about running out of food. It is a big turn off to order something only to find out that they are out of it. In this case, we ordered the sweet potato casserole which my partner had been raving about and craving. It was 7:00 on a Friday night and they were out...dang. Those are my only two complaints, but they are major ones for me. 

On to the positive...the food...I will give them an A+ for the ribs. They were succulent, well seasoned, and smoked to perfection. The BBQ sauce was really good. Surprisingly, the spicy version really was hot. I had to switch to the regular which was also good. My partner had the pulled pork, which I thought was good and he thought was great. The baked beans were delicious. I was pleasantly surprised that the slaw was good. It is listed as creamy. It wasn't very creamy, but the taste was different and enjoyable. The consistency of the mac and cheese was just the way I like it...not too creamy, yet not too dry. It was perfect. The Texas toast wasn't anything to write home about, but when is it ever? Overall, my meal was perfect and I'm having leftovers today. 

I think the reviews complaining about the prices are bogus. 80% of BBQ restaurants all over the country are higher per person than a typical all American restaurant...especially when you order ribs. Also, I think Americans need to stop complaining when they don't have enough food left to take home. It should always be that way. That's why we are so obese as a nation now. Three ribs and a 1/4 chicken with sides should be enough for anyone. Anyway...off of my soapbox for now because I have leftover, delicious Top Notch to warm up.
I heard top notch bbq was the place in vegas for ribs and I wasn't disappointed. They just melt.  I wish I could bbq like this. My wife had the brisket and it was just as savory.  Anytime I'm in Vegas I'll be stopping by here.
Tried it a second time. We had the pulled pork nachos, chicken, brisket, Mac n cheese and green beans. Everything was excellent, the owner even came by and talked with us. Great service too!
This is a great place I went based on some of my fellow yelpers!  I was so happy that we picked this for a lunch treat! 

We walked in and saw the Pulled Pork Nachos on another customers table.  Boy they looked sooo good!!!  I had to order them since I love nachos.  Score! They were absolutely delightful!  It was almost like a masterpiece was delivered to our table.  The toppings made a beautiful portrait of what nachos should look like.  There was so much pork on it that you didn't have to search for pieces to put on each nacho.  We could have easily split them between the two of us for an entree.  Definitely will order them again.

After seeing how much food we had devoured, we decided to split the Pork Sandwich with the chili cheese fries.  OH YUM!  The chili had a great flavor which was smothered on top of the pork in the sandwich.  What a fabulous idea! The fries were crisp even with all of the cheese and chili on top.  

The service was great! She was actually the only one waiting on all of the tables.  There wasn't a moment of down time for her.  With all of that she still kept our drinks filled.  Fantastic! 

This place will definitely be going into our rotation of restaurants!  Our faces and stomachs left with a smile!
Top notch I THINK NOT. I had the pulled pork and all it tasted like was some watered down Kraft BBQ sauce. The meat had no flavor. The sides I ordered were green beans and chili cheese fries. The green beans were just canned green beans in a watered down sauce of some smoked meat and bacon grease, not very tasty and as hot as they were probably just heated up in a microwave. The Chili cheese fries were just a blob of cheese wiz with some taste less chili thrown in and all this made the fries soggy.
They have load music playing and football on the TV. he place is not very inviting. 
It is hard to believe they have been open for 1 year as the quality is bad and prices high. I will not be back again.
I ate there a few months back and just had a burger and it was just ok, kind of high priced at $10.
The food is great but they need more wait help.  Our poor waitress ran herself ragged.  Had brisket, chicken and ribs with mac n cheese, cole slaw, potato salad and green beans.  Everything was delicious.  Even the water was filtered which is rare nowadays!
Best BBQ I ever had! Don't miss out on the sweet potato casserole. Great service too!
We just completed our last dinner in Las Vegas tonight and it just happened to be the best of the week -- at Top Notch Barbeque.  Now, we spent 8 long years in Houston where BBQ is considered a religion (along with college and high school football).  

Without  a doubt Top Notch Barbeque hit it out of the park with us tonight.  We ordered the 4 meat combo which comes with 2 sides.  We ordered the ribs which were excellent, the chicken which also was excellent, the hot links which were excellent, and the brisket which also was excellent.  Notice a trend -- EXCELLENT !!!  As was mentioned by an earlier YELPer, we also could not understand why the brisket was not on the menu.  I mean, really, when you are order BBQ don't most consumers expect for their to be a beef alternative (either brisket or tri-tip)?  I am pretty sure we would all agree -- YES.  For sides we ordered both mac and cheese and sweet potato casserole -- again EXCELLENT!!!  

Now, there was one downer in Top Notch -- we really wanted to try the sweet potato pie but they had run out.  But then, thankfully, we came up with an answer which the restaurant was able to accomodate.  We simply ordered another sweet potato casserole for dessert.  That casserole was absolutely that good !!!

Additionally the service provided by Liz was outstanding PLUS she was friendly and personable.  She gave outstanding advice.  She said to order the ribs, the mac and cheese, and the sweet potato casserole.  She said that they, "were to die for...".    The cook Melissa visited our table to make sure that everything was to our satisfaction.  Another nice touch...

Again, Top Notch Barbeque was our best meal in our week in Vegas.  We will be back...
The service was wonderful.  We came into this place because of a GROUPON.  The men's bathroom was disgusting.  I stuck to the floor walking around this restaurant, and it just seemed like a really good cleaning crew should come in and help this restaurant out.  The food was OK.  My BBQ was not really warm/hot and I was still hungry after sharing a large sampler plate with Paul.  I don't think I will be coming back to this place.  But I did try!
It was even better the second time! Thats a true test of a great restaurant- consistency!

Liz is a great server. She went the extra mile to make sure we had everything we needed.
This is quite the quaint place with cowboy theme on the walls and don't drive by as we almost did as sign says doc hollywoods and have to really look for top notch BBQ sign. 
Ashley was our waitress and she was great, good recommendations and attentive. Always kept glasses full and was patient with us as we kept babbling before and after we ordered... Lol.....
Got the ribs and they were good and tender though I like them to fall off the bone a bit easier. It came with two pieces toast (which I didn't eat since too full), and two sides. The sweet potato casserole was my fave with pecans, and cinnamon! Side of deliciousness! The baked Mac and cheese was also good, quality! They got the brisket and since we tasted each others, I like hers better! It was juicy and falls apart easily like it should... Not quite mama's but closest I have found in town. 
No five stars cause ribs weren't perfect and she wanted to take home pulled pork and they were out of it. But the funniest part of evening was when she tasted the "hot" BBQ sauce, she tasted it the rest of the night and all she could say was "don't eat that"! Facial expressions were classic... Lol
My 100th review for 2013!!!
This place was horrendous in every way possible.  I like to keep an open mind going to new places, frequently buying Groupon's to places I haven't gone to yet to try them out and explore eateries wherever I may be.  This was so bad I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

Let me start to say that the place was not too busy (arrived at 6:15pm) - there was nobody waiting in line as there were a number of empty tables.  It appeared there were very few employees there - during our visit it appeared there was only 1 person to take orders and ring up tickets, 1 person to get drinks and clean tables, and 1 person in the kitchen, there may have been more in the kitchen, but only saw one person from the kitchen carrying out food as since the other half was so understaffed she was running out orders here and there because nobody was picking them up - this spells disaster already.

My guest and I ordered a brisket meal and a pulled pork meal.  IT TOOK NEARLY 45 MINUTES TO GET OUR ORDER, ONLY AFTER ASKING WHAT WAS TAKING SO LONG!  The only good aspect is that for the price of the meal the pulled pork meal had plenty of meat for the price, the brisket meal on the other hand was the severe opposite, very little meat for the higher price paid.  Except for the baked beans on one meals side, the rest of the food was not hot.  The brisket was slightly warm, but the pulled pork and the "famous" sweet potato casserole side dish both meals got were all COLD.  We didn't want to send anything back as it already took 45 minutes to get our food to begin with.

Everybody's food was taking forever.  We overheard other patrons complaining.  Also, the service staff is severely cold and rude.  They never ever came over to see if the food was ok - just finally went to get it when we asked what was taking so long, dropped it off, then we had to wave her down again just to get our check.  Refill of drink, ask if everything was ok with the order?  HAHA not going to happen at this place.  The server even had the gall to tell a patron seated behind me to "come back again, without a Groupon next time" - how rude, they were visibly upset.

The regular sauce is OK, nothing to write home to mom about... and if you like spicy food, the hot sauce is pretty hot, even my Asian friend who loves hot food commented it was a little too hot for a BBQ place.

I will not return, and if it keeps up the tone it had tonight, I would expect this dive to close soon.
I was really impressed with this nice little quaint cowboy restaurant it is rather hard to find next to doc holidays in Henderson. Went there for lunch first time on a Groupon. It was quite busy but the waitresses very attentive and got our order As quickly as she could the food was wonderful especially the rib tips and the Mac and cheese. All of the meat dishes are prepared on site and smoked on site the food is wonderful. I will definitely Return to this restaurant for the great food and atmosphere and wonderful service
Went here on a Tuesday around 530p thinking we'd miss the dinner rush. We still waited 45 minutes for our food then an extra 15 minutes for our check. There were people that got there after us that ate, paid and left before we even got our food. The hot links and mac n cheese were so really good but we won't be returning or recommending this place.
Had dinner here after playing a round of golf. So you can imagine how hungry and thirsty we were. After we ordered our food, which was kind of expensive but were so hungry, we didn't mind. We discovered that they did not serve alcohol. They ask us to go next door to buy beer. We ordered our food and and we did not get our food for about 45 minutes. Like I said, we were so hungry that we were getting ready to leave. The food finally arrived after 45 minutes. We were happy but yet disappointed we had to wait so long.  The food was delicious and the waitress kept saying to us that it was worth the wait. Everything about this place was good with the exception of the service. I don't think you have to wait 40 minutes to bring your food, especially when the food was pre cooked earlier that day because you don't cook pork or chicken in 45 minutes. I gave this place a 3 starbecause of the bad service. I'm concerned that this place will shut down if the service does not improve.
Let me preface by saying my girlfriend and I have had conversations regarding the yelp reviews that are often left.  It is our shared belief that a negative review has more to do with the mood of the diner than it does with the actual service or quality of food.  An unhappy diner is going to be hard to impress in any case and if a server or chef is having an "off" day, like we all do, well than forget about any positive yelping.  Additionally, if food is not to one individuals liking, does that necessarily mean the food is "bad"? Im not sure negative yelp reviews are particularly helpful.  My mom always said "if you cant say something nice, don't say anything at all".

I visited top notch twice this week, once with my daughter on Wednesday the 28th, and then again about two hours ago.  My experience was so positive on Wednesday I just had to return with the rest of the family to be sure it wasn't a fluke.  The food is absolutely fabulous.  Service was not lacking either time.

Our first visit we had the brisket, mac and cheese, green beans, potato salad, and the Texas toast, as well as grape Kool-Aid to wash it down.  Not usually a fan of bbq and brisket often turns into dried out shoe leather which needs to be soaked in sauce to maintain any redeeming qualities. The brisket I was served at top notch was like candy! It was so juicy and fell apart in my fingers-yes, I used my fingers to eat because it was so good. The mac and cheese was awesome, kid and adult friendly at the same time, and my green beans were great.  I might add it was nearly six oclock when we were eating and we noticed plenty of people in there. The service was friendly and we didn't feel ignored at all.

Our second visit was during lunch on a sunday and there were less people present, customers and employees.  Service was still good and we received our food in a timely fashion yet again.  This time I shared a slab of ribs with my son. I NEVER order ribs, too much work for too little reward HOWEVER these ribs were definitely worth the little bit of effort involved. They fell off of the bone and again, that crust was like candy in my mouth.  My daughter had chicken tenders this time and they were good.  My girlfriend had a two item combo with ribs and pulled pork with mac and cheese and baked beans for sides.  That pulled pork was AWESOME! Ignore any other yelper who says differently, trust me.  Again, the green beans and mac and cheese were great.  Texas toast comes in handy for sopping up all of the wonderful meat juices.

Both visits I really enjoyed my grape koolaid.  Satellite radio with some mellow, feel good music in the background- anybody who came in last week and had a bad experience, I say give it another shot.  You are only doing yourself a disservice by staying away.  Some reviews have complained about the sauces or the fact that the ribs arent automatically slathered in any- the meat stands alone, any sauce you may want to add at the table is merely to compliment and is not even necessary. In neither visit did I have a groupon, although it sounds like it was a good deal.  There are two chain bbq joints that I wont mention by name that could really learn a trick or two from top notch.  All I can say is, "you gotta try it!"
came in  for  lunch  today  for the first time  with my family after  my  boy friend had  raved  about this place.  the  food  definetly  lived up to the name!  service  was  good  and my  family  left  happy  and full.... we  will  be regular  customers  from now  on!
The pulled pork sandwich is BBQ perfection. The chili cheese fries are so good it's ridiculous and I want to bathe in the Mac & cheese. I love that this place is casual and that the service has been great on each visit. The sweet tea is awesome and compliments the food so very well. A++++
**This review is on the food only, since I had them once at an event they catered, and again after ordering take-out**

Ribs - Best I can remember having, and I'm from St. Louis.  Not sure what they do to get them this way, especially without smoking them, but damn.

Brisket - Very good.  Perfect balance of smoke and flavor.  Not as good cold, so eat it before it cools off.

Green beans - Above average.  Canned variety I'm used to getting at BBQ joints, but had good meat and spice added to where you wanted to keep eating them.

BBQ beans - Very good again.  Not overly smoky and sticky like a lot of places.  Just the right amount of sausage added.

Texas Toast - Incomplete - Steam made it soggy by the time I got home.

After reading some of the reviews below, I have two additional thoughts...

1)  I do hope this place gets it together on the guest experience side as well.  Competition is too great out here to overcome bad service and not being able to know what's 86ed and what's not at any given time.  Inexcusable.  This will sink you eventually.

2) As a waiter, I hate Groupon too (Too many people who use them are part of that discount community that just wants a deal instead of an experience.  These people are also often idiots and/or cheapskates who, probably on purpose because they see the opportunity,  tip 10-20% on the remainder leftover after the Groupon discount had been applied.  Sorry, but these people screw it up for the rest of you.), but I'd never be a dick about it to a guest.  Yelpers do make stuff up sometimes, especially the angry ones, but fire that waiter immediately, if this was what actually happened.
The BBQ here is always moist with great deep smoked flavor and the dry rub just makes everything better. The ribs are fall off the bone goodness, mmmm. The brisket here is one of best I've tasted in Vegas, in that, they're usually dry in every other BBQ restaurant I've been to, but Top notch's is very moist and delicate, and melts in your mouth. The BBQ sauces are great as well. Don't pay any attention to the actual building itself, it's smells like old furniture and smoke residuals, but the food makes the trip worth while. So good!

Oh an the sides are tasty, too! The baked beans are one of my favorites :) and their sweet potato casserole is like having dessert as a side with your entree ...satisfies my sweet tooth
Generic food. Very disappointed-it's LOWest Notch. First time here-I hate even writing a terrible review but this place is definitely OVER RATED. 
*Walked in and there was two customers the place was EMPTY at 4:30pm on a Friday.
---Brisket was sliced soo thin like deli meat, it was DRY shoestring-like consistency & weird over smoked taste. Worst I ever had and even spit it out at the end cause of the overwhelming smoke flavor. No joke.
---Mac n Cheese was SOGGY & too much cheese globbed on top & I love cheese! But over kill. Took two little bites that's it.
---Potato Salad is like the GENERIC potato salad you buy pre-made in the grocery stores.
-Paid $25 for crappy food, will never come here again.
Michele had a Groupon deal for Top Notch BBQ and we came here after watching a movie down the street.  We walk in and were immediately greeted and taken to a booth. Our waitress realized that our table wasn't wiped down, so she cleaned it really quick.  Now I admit, I am a fan of Rollin Smoke BBQ just west of the strip, and Top Notch was going to have to be on their game to keep up.  So, I used Rollin Smoke as Top Notch's comparison and ended up ordering close to the same thing.  But more of that later.  Anyhow, we looked through the menu as our waitress went to get our drinks that we ordered.  As we were waiting, we set our table with the forks & knives that were in a jar on the table. An interesting touch.  Our drinks come out and our main dish order was written down.

There were 3 of us and this is what we ordered:
M: Brisket with a double order of sweet potatoes
G: Mac 'n Cheese
Me: Ribs with a double order of fries.

The food came out piping hot and the portions were huge. The ribs were stellar and the fries seemed endless. I had a taste of the brisket but wasn't blown away. But, to be fair, brisket isn't my favorite. The sweet potaoes were the way I should have went. It was delicious.  The meal was so huge that I ended up taking half of my order home, where a couple of hours later I devoured the leftovers.

So, I say that Top Notch vs Rollin Smoke is a close battle.  But, I would give the edge to Top Notch.
Awesome authentic smelling and tasting great " down south" like hospitality!! tasty!!!!
Went during lunch. Food took forever to come out. But when it got there, I was happy. Ribs were quite good, but not the star. The chili cheese fries were crazy good!! And for a side on a lunch special, I was blown away at how big the portion was.
Deeelicuous!  Ribs & sausage.  Dry rub, meat falling off the bone.  Plenty of sausage - tasty, with just a touch of sauce.  Food came out fast & hot.  Hit the spot.  Throw in an attentive waitress, what else can you say?   Could have used a few more selections, like corn on the cob, and I prefer my cole slaw with vinegar, but yum
Moved to Henderson from Kansas City about 4 months ago and I was starting to get worried that good BBQ didn't exist out here.  IT DOES!  This place has amazing ribs, and the pulled pork was excellent too!  I wish they had burnt ends but hey I'm not in KC anymore ;)  Great sauce, not too sweet.  Great portions too!  MUST TRY:  The ribs and the sweet potato casserole.  Please keep this family-owned place in business.  There is a Groupon available now that is good until January, if you wanna try for yourself at a lower cost.  Our lovely server, Liz, encouraged it!  Also: Kid-friendly with a nice big, open (read: not stuffy) atmosphere.
I have been here 3 times.  I love the food and service. The best BBQ in LV
This restaurant adjoins Doc Hollidays, but thankfully has its own entrance.  We each ordered the rib platter, a large portion of St. Louis ribs with 2 sides.  These are dry rubbed and slow smoked until they are tender.  We did not feel the ribs required any barbeque sauce.  

For sides we chose (2) sweet potato casseroles that were on the dry side, mac and cheese for my wife that she thought was excellent and Cincinnati chili fries for silly me.  The fries were sloppy and disgustingly good, but I don't think my cardiologist would allow me to ever order them again.  Since I was taking pictures and carrying on about the ribs, our waitress introduced us to owner, Jimmy Cole, a Cincinnati transplant.
Long wait, but SOOOOOO worth it!! They were sadly out of pulled pork, but the brisket and chicken were to die for! I also got the sweet potato casserole and coleslaw and they were both bomb! We also had chili cheese fries that were some of the best I've ever had. Next time I'm for sure gonna get the Mac & cheese cause I tried some of and it was AMAZING. 

Definitely gonna come here again!!!

Way better than Lucille's and Famous Daves :)
I'll just jump straight to the food.

Rib lunch special http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/top-notch-barbeque-las-vegas-2?select=UjvGENIgFgBueatCI_Yj5w#UjvGENIgFgBueatCI_Yj5w
The picture says it all, a large pile of seasoned fries with probably 3 of the better ribs I've had in town. There was a delicious, slightly crisp layer from the dry rub melting with some fat on the rib. There was another delicious layer from the slight pink smoke ring under that. I dont like to much smoke in BBQ. The meat was fall of the bone but firm enough to my liking. I added a little of their spicy sauce just to try the sauce but it really didn't need it it was made right. I wish I had more of the rib but occasionally they run out.

Nachos http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/top-notch-barbeque-las-vegas-2?select=UjvGENIgFgBueatCI_Yj5w#RAXIeZU1KTHVAqPPv3R84w
A huge pile of what seemed and tasted like the packaged nacho chips, some good pulled pork and your typical nacho ingredients olives, jalapeno peppers, sour cream, cheese, etc. Not a big fan probably because of the chips but it was a huge nacho and it was decent. 

Cincinnati Chili Cheese Fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/top-notch-barbeque-las-vegas-2?select=GBHyE6-bCmB5QgYc6lf_xQ#GBHyE6-bCmB5QgYc6lf_xQ
A very delicious chili filled with lots of meat with oozing cheese covering a pile of fries. It was a side dish but large enough to be a meal by itself. This and the ribs were my favorite items here.

Hot Link Sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/top-notch-barbeque-las-vegas-2?select=GBHyE6-bCmB5QgYc6lf_xQ#gvXrXCOe4P73HGcFFq_OWQ They were out of the usual bun so they split the links and put them between a couple of Texas Toast, which I actually  preferred over the bun. It wasn't that bad, a little dry but I enjoyed it more than the nachos.

Brisket. A lot like the ribs delicious outer layer from the rub and fat, another good smoke ring but kind of dry with not a lot of flavor towards the center. I've had a lot better briskets but it was good enough.

Service for some reason has always been slow. It's BBQ shouldn't it already be finish and ready to go before we get there? Cut my pieces off and give me my BBQ already. Busy or not it seems like it always takes the same amount of time to get in and out. Their lunch specials are a lot cheaper than dinner, dinner prices aren't cheap. The ribs and Cincinnati Chili Cheese Fries were 5's. Everything else was maybe a 3-4. Overall a 3.75 rating. For what it's worth I like Top Notch BBQ ribs a lot more than Rollin Smoke ribs.
The best BBQ in Vegas. I have lived here for 30 years and tried every BBQ joint in town. This is the best. I usually get the rib tip dinner. The biggest rib tips anywhere. You get two sides with your meal and there is almost no way to choose. They are all great tasting. Beans, sweet potato casserole, mac and cheese, cole slaw, spicy fries are all unique. Not noisy like Lucille's or Famous Daves. It's on the NE corner of Serene and Eastern adjoining Doc Hollidays. Can't wait to go back again but have to get through all the leftovers from our last visit.
This place is soooo great.The ribs were very good,best baked beans ever had...They put large pieces of hot links in it...Green beans have turkey in it....Very nice people....Will be back.....
Went on a Friday night a little after 7pm and there were 3 tables occupied. Went with 3 other couples. We quickly got our first round of drinks and ordered our food. Then it all went downhill. We waited over an HOUR for our good. When we finally received our food, it would come out 1 or 2 meals at a time, with at least a 10 minute lapse in between the next meal delivery. Drink refills were also ridiculously slow. The food was good, but I think that's because we were starving by the time we received it. We were dining with friends, not eating in shifts. No apologies, nothing from the 3 waitresses on duty. Mind you, there were only 4 tables occupied at any given time on FRI night! Ridiculous. Icing on the cake was the bill had not been separated like asked and gratuity was built in. Will NEVER return.
Went today to this wonderful place to find sign on door that it is closed for business. Have to wonder about these places that open in Doc Holidays why they close after getting good reviews?
Called on Christmas Eve to find out their holiday hours. One of the owners answered and said they were closed for good.

Excellent BBQ, although the place was almost always empty. 

Enjoyed dining at your establishment, best of luck in the future.
Pretty good bbq place. The ribs were darn good. My friend didn't even add bbq sauce. 
The green beans are pretty good, made with turkey thigh. Mac and cheese was delicious! How can you go wrong with Mac and Cheese though? Super good. 

I ordered the brisket dinner and it was very good. Of course I slathered it with a ton of bbq sauce. (I prefer my sauce with a little brisket),  I tried the spicy bbq sauce (you have to ask for it), but it was a little too spicy for me.
 
Cole slaw was pretty good, but I didn't like Cincinnati Chili fries. I mean the fries were ok, but the chili was not for me. Blah

Overall pretty good meal. Kind of expensive at about $18 per meal. But I think it's about the same at most bbq places.
This place is new to me. They had Cochinitas on the menu and I've never had pork prepared that way. It was great in the Torta. Basic menu and good food.
After Zip lining through the jungles and swimming in the Cenote Sagrada (Sacred Well)
we feasted on a local spread which featured Salbutes, Panuchos, Pollo Asada, and Cochinita Pibil. One of our greatest food memories on our visit to Cancun.

Enter Carlos Cervera, a native of the Yucatan and 30-year resident of Las Vegas, and a restaurateur who's taking a gamble, not only opening up a restaurant, but in a location where he calls the "Scary Mall" because of the few businesses that are here,(same mall as Del Taco and Four Kegs off of US 95 North and Jones) Huge space, out of the way location where people don't really frequent, alot is riding on his shoulders...

But I love the optimism and passion of this man, and also in the food he serves here. He along with family members Miguel and their cook who is also family have brought the flavors and soul food of the Yucatan to diners who want to experience the real deal. Yes, he has had to compromise a little to people who come in looking for Tacos, Burritos, and Quesadillas, which is why he has those items on the menu as well.

We started off with some chips and two great tasting salsas, and a vegetable soup filled with potatoes, carrots, and chayote. After a pretty lengthy conversation with Carlos and Miguel about our visits to Cancun, the places, culture, and people, and his early "rocker" days(His fave artist is Jimi Hendrix) out of nowhere comes two tamales-One done in the Yucatan style steamed in Banana Leaf and One in the usual corn husk topped with a really complex Mole-both filled with chicken, but each having their own distinct flavor.

Carlos also put together an assortment of Panuchos for us-Fresh tortillas smeared with refried black beans, meat(we had chicken, turkey, and cochinita pibil) topped with lettuce, tomato, and avocado-one bite of this instantly brought me back to that Zip lining moment through the jungle, and if food can make me do that, you can bet that I'm a fan! We finished off with some Arroz con Leche topped with bananas, raisins and cinnamon, which had a great flavor but the rice was just a hair under(not as bad as the Embers risotto though...;0) We don't really know the full total because he didn't charge us for our full order(sneaky guy) but we one-upped Carlos, added the menu prices up and left a hefty tip on top of it. He asked us to sign his "Good Luck" book and we thanked him and his family.

It is businesses like this I love to continue and support, I am in the process of working out the deets with Carlos so we can all gather up once again for a taste of the Yucatan...Stay tuned!....ALOHA!!!!

YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(47/100) "Soul Food of the Yucatan...:9"
After reading Nelson's review, I had to try this place.  It is hiding in plain sight.  I can't believe the number of times I've passed on the freeway and saw that large open shopping plaza, much of it empty, and little did I know there was a gem of a restaurant right in my line of sight.

I stopped here after a "Showgirls of Las Vegas" program at the Nevada State Museum.  I was the only customer at 5:10 and remained the only customer for the hour I was there.  It's a shame.  They should have more business.

I got the chips and salsa and I asked for the hot salsa.  That salsa with habanero peppers is quite good.  The mild salsa is fine, too, and I liked the small bits of avocado in the mild salsa.

The woman brought me a bowl of complimentary soup. It was not the vegetable soup shown in other photos for Chicken Itza but rather a noodle soup--fideo soup.  It was very good and very hot!!  Let it cool for awhile so you don't burn your lips, tongue, throat, and anything else to which this may come in contact!

For dinner, I ordered the panuchos.  Since there are three to an order, I got one, chicken, one turkey, and one pork (cochinita pibil).  All three were excellent!  The split tortilla filled with refried black beans with the tasty meat and toppings were super!! The meats were very juicy and this was a more than one napkin experience.  The meat could have been a bit hotter, but it didn't detract from the flavors.

For dessert, I had arroz con leche which was not complimentary.  It is really, really, good!  It had a nice amount of cinnamon, raisins, and bananas and there seemed to be some pieces of crust as if the rice and milk were baked in a pie crust of some kind.

The horchata was very good. 

I'm coming back to try their other Mayan (Yucatan) specialties!  It is so wonderful to live in such a diverse city with all these different foods from which to choose.
My husband and I read a review about Chicken Itza, and found out is was around the corner from our house, so we had to try it !! I had the panuchos, which were very tasty and my husband had the salbutes which he said they were also good. We got spoiled by the chef/owner (??) with their vegetable soup as our appitizer, then he also treated us to his mole' chicken tamale which was very yummy, then we also were treated with the Spanish version of rice pudding with cinnamon and raisins and sugar and cinnamon tortilla chips, was ultra yummy !! We were so spoiled that I bill was only what we ordered and that only came to $16. We actually went back the very next day to try the burritos (which we also loved) and we got to try the noddle (fideo ?) soup which was also great !! We are so glad it's around the corner from our house, we plan on going at least once a week :-)
Mmmm Chicken Itza 

After seeing this listed on Yelp as one of the new recommendations I couldn't wait to try it out. Chicken Itza is located off of Jones and the 95 in the same shopping center as the new CAL Ranch store. The decor was very pleasant and lively with brightly colored chairs and fun sombreros hanging from the ceiling. The waitress very helpful with her food recommendations. I couldn't help but admire the freshly made to order food. 

Chips and Salsa Verde: The chips that were brought to the table were hands down some of the best i have had of late. They were perfectly crunchy and very refreshing when paired with the yummy salsa verde with the fresh chunks of avocado. They were so good we almost ate the whole basket. 

The soup: The soup was a pleasant surprise and brought to us along with the chips. It seamed to be a broth base with lentils and strips of pork with vegetables. My boyfriend enjoyed his more than I practically scrapping the bowl. 

The Chicken Panuchos #1: So yummy, I was a little upset at myself for not being able to finish them but my stomach was so full after the unexpected treats. I ended up taking to of them home to finish after my food coma and they were just as great. I wish I had more. 

Chicken Mole Enchilada: My boyfriend devoured this in less then five minutes. You know its good when you have to sneak your fork in to steal a bite. 

Chicken Mole Tamale: Usually not a fan of mole, but this had to be one of the best sauces I have ever tried. The chef made this special for us and that always gets points in my book. 

I will be back and plan on making it to dessert next time.
While you wait for your meal they bring out chips, salsa and their soup of the day! I miss Cancun and this place reminds me of that happy place with their native cuisine would be waiting for us to sample after swimming in a senote sagrado exploring ancient ruins and zip lining through the jungle. 

The owner made some suggestions and we tried tamales, Salbutes, Panuchos, and Cochinita Pibil tamales topped with mole negro.  All that was missing was the most popular soup in all of Yucatan their "Sopa de Lima" which I will have to return to try. This is a family owned and operated restaurant and you can definitely sense their pride in every dish. I will say to keep in mind that every state in Mexico will have their own food specialties and will differ from state to state which in my opinion makes trying Chicken Itza a unique dining experience.
Just found this place and my coworkers and I have officially placed it into our weekly rotation.  The owner is awesome.  He is so passionate about his food and its authenticity.  As soon as we sat down, he brought out homemade chips with 3 different kinds of salsa - including a very spicy habanero (my favorite by far).  He then brought out some kind of soup with lentils and barley, which was great.

The menu is very simple, which is ALWAYS a good sign.  Food was perfect. The atmosphere is so authentic, I kept having to remind myself that I WASN'T in Cancun on vacation.
Dang, Cabron!
What a surprise. Thought we'd eaten most of what was to be eaten on the West side, then THIS! Feels like you are in the Yucatan.

Clean aftertastes. That is HUGE when it comes to Mexican food. Chicken Itza has it dialed. The Habanero salsa is perfect - not too spicy, not too 'buttery'-tasting. I poured it all over my food just like a typical salsa - a first. (And I did not regret it later in the day :)

My sizzling hot plate ($6) of chicken enchiladas w/rice & beans was fantastic and generous. The special Yucatan-style pork mini-tostadas ($6) were amazing as well. Plenty of food. 

It only took one time to know I was going to be a regular. 

Friendly Yelp Tip: IF you're a freaky fan of Komex or of Taqueria La Mexicana, you will definitely want to try Chicken Itza. I won't give away the ending (but I think you may have found your new value spot.)
After living in Southern California, it's hard to impress me with Mexican food. I'm used to real mexican food, great street tacos, and getting it all cheap. Chicken Itza is better than any other mexican food I've had in Las Vegas because it's real.  The curb appeal of the shopping center is lacking, but my favorite foods always come from dives and holes in the wall. The chicken in the enchiladas was amazing, their green sauce made me tongue happy and their horchata was authentic. We spoke with the owner, and he is delightful. Give Chicken Itza a chance, your taste buds will thank you.
Great food from the Yucatan!  Care and tlc in their product.  Carlos is a character and makes you feel welcome.  The habanero salsa is a winner if you can handle it (which i do a drop at a time!).
What a find!  Don't be put off by the location - I-95 and Jones - next to the Cal-A-Ranch Store.  The panuchos and salbutes were fabulous.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Definitely a must try!
Excellent traditional Mayan cuisine! We found this place on Yelp and loved it!! We will definitely come back. The cochinita pibil enchiladas were delicious!!
The only reason I gave this two stars... Is the fact it is open all night.

My husband and I arrived in Las Vegas much later than we intended (due to a dead battery!) so by the time we checked into Circus Circus we were famished. 

We were under the assumption Las Vegas was one of those 24/7 kind of towns and were shocked at how much was closed. 

We found the Pizzaria and were so relieved SOMETHING was open. The pleasure stops there. 

We ordered a 10 inch pesto pizza and it was awful. First off, the only thing pesto about it was the fact there were full pine nuts on it. Otherwise all I tasted was garlic. Everything garlic. Now I love garlic but not when it's the only flavor.

The crust wasn't too bad and tasted reasonably fresh (no frozen) but the toppings were a disaster. Take it from me, if its late... Find a McDonald's. This location was a disappointment.
Meh!

We ordered this for room service and they messed up our whole order, but we were already so fed up with this hotel we took what we got and ate.....the food was ok....if you like chuck e. cheese pizza.

the salad was gross and we asked for ranch and got Italian.

My son and dad loved it....thats the only reason for 3 stars
The BBQ chicken tasted a little too much like BBQ chicken and had me forget that I was eating a pizza. It was DRENCHED in BBQ sauce and had me regretting that me and my boyfriend ordered it. I had already ordered mild chicken wings as a appetizer and was actually wanting a pizza =(

Let me add that another couple was sitting near us and asked how the BBQ chicken pizza was and we had to tell the truth - "order something else".

They have a soda fountain available so you don't have to wait for your server to refill your drink for you. I guess it can be a hassle to get up to refill your drink though when it needs to be refilled so I guess it's all about how you look at it.

Our server though was skimpy on the napkins and ranch. My boyfriend asked for more ranch and she gave us just ONE MORE PACKET. I guess I'm just use to being given several servings of ranch, but that's just me.

The only good thing I can deduct from this place is that it is open 24 hours. That didn't really have an effect on me since I live in Las Vegas, but I guess it would be more convenient to anyone staying at Circus Circus wanting to get a late night bite.
Modern Grill is a new restaurant providing fresh pizza, salads, and sandwiches in NE Phoenix. They also have a bar and small market area with wine, specialty jams and other unique grocery items. Their original location is in Flagstaff and they are now expanding to the metro Phoenix area. Several items are sourced locally for freshness and almost all dishes are made from scratch. On my first trip, I went for breakfast and ordered their bacon, egg and cheese panini. The egg was cooked perfectly for a sandwich and the bacon was very flavorful. Coffee is self serve in the morning, and available in a to go cup to top of for the road.  The staff is friendly and quick to serve customers, today even passing out free pumpkin muffins! I will be back to try dinner.
This is the kind of place our neighborhood needed! The food was fantastic, the staff beyond helpful and great decor. We had a salad, brushetta and a pizza. It was all delicious and fresh. I can't wait to go back for happy hour!
What a great place! Food is fresh and delicious. The wait staff is super friendly and helpful. Great atmosphere to bring the kids. We love the open air concept and will be coming back often. The cookies are awesome. So glad this is in our neighborhood.
We ate there last night. We had the "gluten friendly" free Bianca Pizza, it was very good. We loved the atmosphere, the staff was very friendly. We will definitely be returning. Welcome to the neighborhood.
Great place! Very nice and friendly. Concept is very unique as you can order your own food until 4 after wards, restaurant changes to a sit down restaurant.

Food was AHHH MAZING! 
we ate very light. Strawberry Salad and pizza. 

I am in mesa and very worth the Drive!!
Average food, awful service.  Giving them three stars since they haven't been open long. 

I had chicken salad sandwich.  Flavorful but bread was extremely dry, and the chicken salad itself has scant mayo or whatever it is holding it together, so I choked it down with several glasses of water.  My side of fruit salad would be better coined as "bowl of melons".

Husband had bacon cheddar burger, which was over cooked and bland.  He said side of pasta salad was really good however.

Our server has now walked by our table eleven times without bringing the check.  Not impressed.  Hope they work out the kinks and confusion, seems like this place has potential but there is LOTS of disorganization and confusion by waitstaff and kitchen commotion.
Groovy new spot and very nice staff, outside dining and modern design... And good location. 

Enjoyed dinner, mushroom burger was really good including the sweet potato fries and macaroni balls!
Got takeout opening day a portabello burger
Side o fruit salad small and not ripe
Had 2 bites o burger but got up for min and dog ate it
It was just ok
Came back for 7 brekkie pastry they open 7 but was told pastry coming out 730
Not cool
But i suspect they will try to get it together
Will come back later
4/26/14-  Bartender Peanut mixed me a special brew. 4/5 Hella Pils and 1/5 Firehouse IPA. Changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars!  

Added after meal:  decided to go to the restroom before I left. NOT COOL!  Unisex sink area- guess I'm just old fashioned that way. I don't want to share a sink area and toilet with men.  I hope this isn't a new trend. 

Maybe they don't have the kinks worked out yet, so I'll give 2 stars for this visit. 
My sandwich - turkey and cheddar panini - was delicious. My fries were cold. Hubby's Cuban panini seemed to be assembled by a child- Cuban is turkey, ham and pickles- all the turkey was on one side of the bread, all the ham was on the other side and the pickle was only in the middle - so it was more like 3 sandwiches rather than the delicious combo of flavors that a Cuban should be. 
Let me just say that I never really understood the concept of placing your own order, picking a seat then having a "server" bring you the food. While waiting much too long for a panini, I saw the food delivery folks wandering all around almost dropping food looking for the right table. Also, you have to get your own drinks and condiments including salt and pepper. But you can bet there was a line for a tip in the credit card slip!  Since I did most of the work, it puts me in a pickle when it comes to tip amount. 
Outside seating and bar are really cool though and the music didn't suck. I'll be back to see if things improve.

I will update this review after/we return.  First bad sign was at the register.  The girl taking our order was ok but not exactly customer service oriented or friendly.  We ordered 3 appetizers so we could try a few different. 

Finally after 25 minutes 1 of the appetizers showed up (Mac n cheese balls). They were pretty good. Not amazing but good. About 5 minutes later our kale salad arrived.  I will say that the kale salad was fantastic. If I return again I'll order it for sure.  We were told our 3rd item (pretzels)  was going to be "right out". Well 20 minutes later (55 minutes total) they still haven't been delivered, no one has checked on us and our daughter is done sitting still so it's time go. 

I understand things happen in a restaurant but if you can't a soft pretzel taken care of in under an hour after you've been fully aware that there was an issue with this order 25 minutes in then you've got serious problems.  

We really wanted to like this place.  It's got great outdoor seating and is right around the corner from my house.  Not sure yet if I'll give them another chance.  If I do. I'll update this review.


Update : went back a 2nd time and had an equally disappointing experience.  We want to like this place but I can't imagine returning.
We needed a place like this in the neighborhood! 

The family and I checked it out for a late lunch yesterday. Cool space in the new strip mall. Order at the counter and find your own seat.

I had the bacon cheddar burger with sweet potato fries. Both were delicious

The Mac and cheese bites were delicious.

My wife had the vegetable panini which she really liked.

Our service was great and overall we both loved it.


Will be back for sure.
I'm rooting for this neighborhood restaurant, but they really need to work on their customer service. The atmosphere is great, very cute and so far, after 3 visits, I can only say the food is just okay.  I would and want to continue to come back, but their service is NOT good. They really need to work on improving. C'mon, step it up! We want you to stay in business!!
I've only had to-go from Modern Grove, and my experience was pretty good. I ordered the veggie sandwich which had an abundance of grilled vegetables and creamy goat cheese. For my side I decided on pasta salad, the woman who took my order made sure to warn me that there was meat in the pasta salad, since I had ordered a vegetarian sandwich. I think it's great that she was paying close attention to such details, even though I'm a carnivore and meat was no problem. Once I got the sandwich, it turned out to be huge. The photo I have is of it cut in half, but it's actually two layers of sandwich on top of each other. The portion size was very generous. The bread that came on it was foccacia style and a perfect texture. The pasta salad was very good too, it had lot's of flavor. I will definitely return to try more of the menu.
Have been to this place twice since it opened a week or so ago.  Very delcious food.  Love the Mac and cheese bits with their bacon aioli dipping sauce.  So good the dipping sauce should be offered with the fries automatically.  Only thing I could say that they need to work on is their table running.  They have an indoor outdoor area and it seems as though they have no system on what numbers they hand out during the brunch/lunch hours.  Servers walk around looking for numbers as the food cools.  Definitely worth a try, but they still have a few kinks to work out.
This place is completely unprepared at all times. 45 minutes after placing my to-go order; I finally receive my food. Def NOT worth the wait. Overall; I don't recommend Modern Grove & my advice to them would to be hire better &/or more staff.
From the outside, this place is very inviting, I could not wait to try it!   They've been open a little over a week.   Tonight my husband and I checked it out.   The décor, ambiance and feel of the place were great.  However, the positives end there.    We were seated promptly, however it took 50 minutes to get our food.   
There were about 10 people in the kitchen, so we were thinking food would be sent out pretty quickly.  We were wrong.   I ordered the Capri Sandwich (Mozzarella, red peppers and prosciutto) and my husband ordered the steak Panini.
It should not take 50 minutes for these items.
Sandwich:  Bread was STALE!  Very Stale, it was so hard I could hear a noise when I banged the crust on the table.   There needs to be more quality control in the kitchen and this item should NOT have been served to anyone.   The side pasta salad was also hard- you could tell it had been left in open air and was not sealed for storage until use....
Panini: very fatty, not great quality of meat.
It took awhile to get our check.  We could not wait to get out of there.
Management:  Please have a quality control person in your kitchen to inspect everything before it leaves the kitchen and served to customers.  For a new restaurant, there are sure to be some kinks, but the quality of food served, after waiting 50 minutes for it was not acceptable.
Hopefully they straighten up their act, or this place will not be open for long.
this place should have tested some things out before opening...

like the food, the service, the food, the service... (what else is there?)

sat down and immediately heard several managers apologizing to many tables about how late the food was coming out. the table next to us was one of those tables. they then got their food, lady took a bite and gentleman cut open his burger and they both literally got up and left! YIKES! we already ordered, so we were stuck now...

food arrives about 25-35 minutes later. pizza comes out first which was interesting because the other items were two salads and a sandwich (nothing to cook). pizza was bright orange because of how much grease was sitting on top :( about 5 minutes later two salads came out... not our salads...so back to the kitchen they go. my husbands sandwich came out with fries when he ordered fruit. the menu isnt that complex, what is the deal? his sandwich was so dry he had to chug water between bites (chicken salad sandwich) the edges of the bread were rock solid/inedible. fruit salad i think was left over from breakfast because the dish was filled with juice and fruit was mush. as for the salads, they finally came out correct...but i think the lettuce was mix from when they opened. my husband works in the produce industry, and i couldn't even fork my spring mix because it was so mushy and flat. i ordered the chicken strawberry salad and the chicken was waaaay overcooked, couldnt even cut it with a fork to break it up. had to saw into it with a knife (these are 3 little nugget pieces anyway). 

went to leave, had to walk to the counter to get my check because the 17 people standing in the kitchen/front area couldn't seem to get it together. what could go wrong now? of well i was billed for the salad that i got incorrectly...they showed me the check for my bill and then charged me an extra $8...so 15 minutes later they got it fixed (still crossing my fingers that i dont get charged first) and then offered me a buy one get one free lunch... thanks but no thanks. i'll be driving right past this place or even going next door to firehouse. 

the structure is beautiful but service and food are kind of a bigger deal...!
I went for lunch I will not return for lunch but will try for dinner the menu is the same but I'm hoping experience will be much different . First off I'm not a fan of the concept of the restaurant being cafe style during day & sit down at night, it would make since if the menu was different durning day  but for how hot food is prepared I don't want a paradise bakery experience on walking up to order and then going to counter to pick up it was a bit of a disaster. Service is in great need of getting things to run smoothly here but it is a new restaurant so I'm sure it will get worked out . The food was ok nothing great but I would go back for convenience  of being close to hm , I do love the decor and urban vibe atmosphere the patio dining is really fun & cute! Reasonably priced menu options and kid friendly I will go back to try the dinner experience but for now it I would only give it 2.5/3 stars will update again after dinner experience
I drive by this place everyday to work. Finally stopped by on my day off with my daughter. I got the chopped salad and she got the chicken panini. The salad I could of made at home and better. I am not kidding when I say it had one slice of bell pepper, a few bits of cheese and pepperoni. It was all lettuce. If I'm going to pay 9.00 for a chopped salad I am going to get my money's worth and go up the street to Oreganos. My daughter's panini was bland and the fries that came with it were underdone (hard inside and cold). The place is attractive and the outdoor bar is really nice. But, the food doesn't cut it. Will not go back nor would I recommend.
Everytime we drive passed this place it's packed. My family and I stopped in for some lunch.  Line went fast, about 20 min wait, Well Worth It! I had the marinated steak panini, melts in your mouth! The fries are on the spot! Crispy on the outside soft on the inside.  My fiancé loved the cheddar bacon burger.  Highly recommend this place!!
On my way to an appt today, I stopped in to have lunch and check it out.  It is rare that I am out and about without my kids, so I was looking forward to an awesome lunch.

I followed the sign pointing me to the register to order, and got in line behind a large family.  I waited....and waited....and waited as about seven of them each placed an order.  Suddenly behind me I hear a voice saying to go to another register that opened.  I assume the voice is talking to me, since I am next.  But no...she is talking to the people BEHIND me in line!?!

Really?  How hard is it to take the next person in line?  Realizing with this kind of service I would never make my appointment if I continued waiting, I left.  My first impression of your restaurant is one of disorganization and snide staff, because when the woman realized she'd skipped me, she said she thought I was with the other group (despite being behind them, not with them...and she should have asked).  She made no effort to make amends, and if management can afford to let paying customers leave their very first time visiting, shame on them.

Very disappointed, thought we finally would have a neighborhood spot for our family, since several of us live in the neighborhood, but I guess not.  Not to mention the vibe in the place was pure chaos, which isn't a pleasant atmosphere to dine in.
Went to Modern Grove on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch with my boyfriend. It reminded me of a Fox Concept but not as good. I really liked the look, the ambiance, the patio, and the overall feel of the place. It's a very laid back, come how you are type of place. The menu was okay, nothing I haven't seen before. Food was good, again nothing new, very basic salads and sandwiches. What Modern Grove has going for them is the ambiance, the patio, the grab n go market, the welcoming feel, and the convenient location. The service however, is severely lacking. Two food runners brought us our entrees and didn't bother to ask if we needed anything else. Just literally sat the plates down and walked away while carrying on with their conversation. We were sitting at the bar and not one of the THREE bartenders (there are only 16 stools and only about 6 were occupied) bothered to check on us. I finally interrupted someone to ask for salt and pepper and some ketchup for our fries. I saw managers sitting and eating, then sitting again, not doing anything productive to keep guests happy. You would think for a brand new place they would be doing more to promote their business, stopping by tables, introducing themselves, etc. Not so much. Hopefully, with time, the service will improve. It will probably be some time before I come back again. To sum it all up: Food: average Ambiance: good Service: amateur
I am really hoping this place gets it together soon. It is such an awesome location. However, our service and food was pretty bad. It took over 20 min for a waitress to take our order. (We were there around 5, so it wasn't busy.) My burger was over done and tastes rubbery. My kids food came our cold. It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk. I have this place two stars because the manager took care of our bill (we weren't the only ones to complain...) and because the grassy patio is really nice.
Cool setting and environment.  I really wanted to like the food because of this, but it was only so-so.  The bar is nice and they have good beers on draft and it's not overly expensive.  I wouldn't come back for the food, but I'd go back to have a drink and sit on the patio.
Really great new place! Hip decor, good food, great beer prices. The service was a little messy, but not surprising since they're new. Looking forward to trying this place again!
After seeing this new restaurant in our neighborhood we were anxious to try it.  Based on their website we decided to try it for Happy Hour.  The place is open and attractive.  When our server arrived my husband asked him what the happy hour wine was and his answer was that they didn't have happy hour YET.  He said that some things are happy hour priced but he didn't know what they were.  I told him they needed to update their website which clearly states they have happy hour and even have the menu posted.  We ordered the Cubano sandwich.  It was attractively presented, however, there was no turkey or cheese.  It was a very thin sandwich with two slices of ham and lots of pickles,  which did not cover the bread.  Very disappointing for the price.  The potato salad, however, was excellent.  Never once did anyone check to see how our meal was, including the manager.  The server was young and inexperienced.  We left disappointed.  Yesterday in the AZ Republic they featured this restaurant as a new Phoenix restaurant and mentioned the non-existant happy hour.  They have a long way to go if they are going to be successful.  Right now they are in the "honeymoon phase" but that will not last forever.
4/7/14:  food is still good, but again, service is a disorganized mess.  Server appeared before our butts were in the chairs, so we rushed to figure out what we wanted to drink.  They were out of two of the five beers on tap, but husband ordered one of the remaining three and I asked about the wines, and she knew nothing about them. I rolled the dice and ordered the red blend. 

She returned quickly with waters for us, and then we placed our order:  pretzel sticks appetizer to share, Italian chopped salad and hail kale salad for me.

A few minutes go by and ALL of the food arrived, but we still had no beer or wine.  Thankfully the person who delivered our food went and grabbed our drinks from the bar for our server.

Pretzel sticks were ok.  Better than most, but not as good as the pretzels from Haus Murphy, which is expected. Warm, light, fluffy, but blandish and not much salt.

Kale salad was good.  Baby kale leaves, crunchy pistachios, mandarin oranges, cranberries, and vinaigrette, which was lightly flavored and tasty.

Husband said Italian chop salad was "ok"...wasn't bad, wasn't great.  Note: if you order this, your meat is sparse and on the bottom.

Ordered cheesecake for dessert when I started to update this review, still hadn't arrived...and I'm a slow phone typist.

Still hopeful they get their ducks in a row--it's a great concept, just poorly orchestrated at this point.
Food is okay, not as imaginative or special as I had hoped. Wedge Salad was solid.  The 4 cheese panino lacks any special touches or flavors.  This place has a great deal of potential with a few tweaks.  Got free deserts to try, that is a great touch to gain wider favor.  Staff was a bit over eager but that is likely due to it being opening day
Took the kids to breakfast and was completely under whelmed. While lunch and dinner include a wait staff, breakfast is served cafeteria style. Yuk.  Order your food, wait, food comes out ..... nuts, didn't get silverware so go back in (we sat outside as apparently I hadn't ingested enough car exhaust) and nuts again as I forgot to get a drink.  They don't have a full bar so forget a breakfast bloody and the food was very forget able as well.  They employees were very nice, bright and cheerful so perhaps we will try it again for lunch or dinner.  Breakfast?  Not so much
This place is amazing! I love their staff and the decor and more importantly the food. My children loved the fruit and sandwiches as well my husband and I enjoyed our burgers and french fries. Food had such great flavor and was cooked to perfection! The staff was eager to help my family and myself from the moment we entered the door. I don't know about you but if that isn't great customer service then I don't know what it is! I will definitely return soon and tell all my friends and family about the new and exciting Modern Grove. I give them !
I am writing this review from the restaurant. Why, may you ask am I writing this from the restaurant and not ... Oh... Let's say eating or perhaps drinking? Well we have been sitting here for one hour (not an exaggeration - it's a Thursday. We got here at 7:45. It is now 8:48). Our appetizer has now arrived as well as my daughter's Mac and cheese, my husband's grilled cheese and a random pizza "on the house". It's been an hour. 

The appetizer we ordered is the Mac and cheese bites which are not bad. The cheese and bacon sauce is pretty good and really delish if you dip your sandwich.

(Btw, 8:56 and the manager just came over. He apologized profusely and said he was embarrassed and offered to comp our meal. 3 of us still don't have a meal. The manager just came back to ask what we ordered)

My daughter really loves her Mac and cheese which looks pretty delicious.

I ordered the traditional iced tea which is really good and has a strong tea flavor. I like it a lot. I've also had a lot of it. :)

It's 9:03.

My husband is now taking my daughter home to put her to bed. She's 3.

9:08! My food is here! My friend's food is here! My mother-in-law's food is not.

Ok. Now we have our food. MIL has pizza Bianca. She likes it and says that you can really taste the different cheeses. There's arugula on it which gives the pizza bite and adds some delicious flavor. 

Both my friend and I ordered cheeseburgers . They were flavorful, but the kitchen put the whole burger under the broiler and that burned the top of bun and made the bun strangely greasy. I also thought that the patty was a bit thin which made it somewhat dry. Flavorful, but a bit dry.

Now, we also ordered a bread pudding to go when we ordered almost 2 hours ago, but I think we're going to just let it go. 

Food is a 2
Experience is a 0 but it's a cute place so it's a 1
And so it's a 1 and a half, but the manager asked us to come back and try it again and I will give it the benefit of the doubt, so it's a 2.
Update: french fries and hash browns recipes changed. They were better when they first opened. I can't seem to get an answer on the change. Not as good. 

Great place. Great atmosphere. With open indoor and patio dining. Just had their grand opening and the service is getting to match the good good they serve. A must try if you live in the PV/Scottsdale area. Love the San tan hefe!
Long wait for food. Food arrived cold. Disorganized waitstaff. Nice patio but I can get that at home. Go to Firehouse Subs. It's just down the way...
Truly disappointed. This restaurant has so much potential but seems to be run by those from the Island of Misfit Toys. I gave this place 2 chances: lunch and dinner. Our dinner experience was that of everyone else listed. Took 2hrs for all of food to be brought and it came piece by piece over the 2hrs. It was kids Mac n Chz (cold & gross), side of sweet potato fries (cold) and caprese salad (quite nice). Gave benefit of the doubt as they had opened only a few weeks ago and tried lunch today. Still horrible. Ordered our food at the register, offered my card to pay and was told it would be 35 min wait for a burger and salad. really? I snatched my card back and told the gal to delete our order.  she seemed shocked we wouldn't wait. 

We will not return and have advised neighbors and friends of our experience there. 

Honestly, it seems the customers desperately want this place to to be their neighborhood cafe but ppl won't wait forever for this place to get its act together.
We stopped in Saturday about 12:30 and ordered at the counter.  Apparently this place is order at the counter by day and traditional restaurant style service at night.

We ordered the hummus, kale salad, and Mac n cheese bites. We got our iced tea, which they have 3 kinds, and waited...

After 35 minutes our food finally comes out, well the Mac bites and hummus. A food runner comes over with a kale salad which we tell her we are waiting on.  She then looks at the menu and takes our salad back to the kitchen and then starts cashiering... We tell another runner we are waiting on a kale salad so she goes into the kitchen and brings that same salad back to us.  Word to the managers- hot pink scrunchie employee is not helping you!!!!

The food itself was actually quite good.  The Mac bites were warm and yummy- the pasta was not overlooked.  The hummus comes with yummy pita chips and olives and feta on top of the hummus.  The kale salad was my favorite with pistachios and mandarin oranges.

If we had gotten our food without the confusion, if rate modern grove 4 stars.
Oh boy! They could really use some good management. Great concept but the poor employees have NO clue what they are doing. Maybe they opened too soon!
This place had potential too! Bummer. The decor is lovely, but the service is AWFUL. We ordered dinner and drinks...WE ended up having to go up to the bar ourselves to get the drinks after waiting 15 minutes. Our food took over 30 minutes to come out, and my bruschetta came out totally wrong. They have a pick 3...and the server brought out 1 out of the 3 I ordered. My husband ordered a burger and it was just ok.

I wish they would have executed the service, because it really is a cute place. Definitely will not be returning to Modern Grove.
Great atmosphere.  It definitely helps revitalize the intersection at Tatum and Greenway.  The restaurant itself is really cute and lives up to its vibe of being a modern neighborhood eatery.  Love the outdoor space with the outdoor bar and the cornhole boards.

I got the gobbler (turkey burger) which was pretty solid as far as turkey burgers go.  The toppings were generous (there was half an avocado on top -- yum).  The portions are pretty good for the price and the fries are delicious.  

We went during lunch rush hour and while it was busy we didn't feel like our service was sacrificed.  Our food came out pretty much immediately after we had sat down.  Parking can be really busy (we had to park all the way down at Walgreen's).  

The one thing -- and this is an odd complaint -- is that there weren't any napkin dispensers anywhere.  All of the silverware came wrapped in a napkin but when my hubby spilled his coffee we had no choice but to grab three or four silverware sets just to use the napkins.
First timers. Everyone is talking about this place. We had to try it.

Absolutely exceptional customer service. Tina was so accommodating and willing to do what made my sister happy.. She had order the Cubano Panino, not realizing that there's massive mustard in the sandwich. Tina took it back with no hesitation,  gave her another sandwich with no mustard., not only that, she also put sweeet potato fries on the side for her on the house!! 

I ordered the Grove, vegetarian of course. It was okay. Not bad not good. The sweet potato is really good :)

I drove far for this.. I would come back :)
First time. I may come again to try something else. I got a pizza and while it was very good the crust tasted like it needed salt. It had a fig spread, caramelized onions, goat cheese, and topped with ham. The fig spread was delicious and my husband kept stealing my pizza. His pizza was extremely bland. There wasn't any sauce and it basically was arugula and ham on a bland crust. My kids got cheese pizza which was good. The atmosphere is fun and the service decent. So I'll give it another try.
I have gone twice both for lunch, the restaurant is charming but anyone can make  trendy country decor. The food is hit and miss. They need to figure out what is working and what is not, there is no consistency. 

First time we ordered the chips and dip, was a hit and had unique texture and taste. The apple chicken sandwich was falling apart and light but nothing to write home about. The bruschetta was blah.

Second time was a birthday celebration and two haven't been there before. I fore warned not to get their hopes up. Two ordered the mushroom burger, cashier didn't ask the temp, so it came our well done. Looked like a flat dry piece of meat. Then the strawberry chicken salad on field greens was disappointing due to the chicken being over cooked and so dry we had trouble cutting it let alone swallowing it.

I ordered the margarita pizza to play it safe this time. It was flavorful and good. With the overall experience it's not worth the wait, time, or money. I might try it again in a few months after they work some kinks out!
I have been here twice.  The first time was fine and the food was good.  There were not many guests so the service was quick.  Based on the first time I would recommend this place to everyone.  The second time I went was not good at all.  It was busy but not all the tables were full.  It took 25 minutes to get chips and dip and we had to ask another waitress to remind our waiter.  It took a total of 45 minutes to get our sandwiches.  My sandwich was very good tasting but my wife's sandwich was completely black, not brown but black.  It was inedible.  Needless to say; the wait was bad and then the food, and even though the waiter was nice, he spent a lot of time just standing at the kitchen and not taking care of his tables.    We were not the only table waiting so there was obviously a problem in the kitchen and people were upset.  I am not sure if I will try it again but maybe they will get another chance.  On the positive side, when we showed the waiter the sandwich, which he had to see when he brought it to our table, they did not charge us for anything.  At least I have a free meal but we had to go somewhere else to get my wife something.  She didn't like my sandwich.
Very cool decor, it was a fun and casual environment. Dog friendly outside which is a plus. I had the margherita pizza which was pretty good. Will def go back to try something else.
Takes a page from the LGO/Liberty Market blueprint for creating the neighborhood friendly market/bar that seems to be ever popular these days.  Unlike others my service was prompt and like most others my meal was good.
Solid, fresh lunch place! While there is nothing spectacular about the menu, the ingredients are super fresh. The house made bread is really an awesome touch.

We went during lunch which is self serve. Found staff to be very helpful and friendly. 

Chicken salad sandwich is refreshing as was the tuna salad sandwich. Tuna was a bit heavy on the mayo but would give it another try. I rather enjoyed the mayo-less potato salad with fresh herbs and the inclusion of sweet potato cubes. 

Panini's are nice as well. My husband had the roast beef panini and he said it was very nice and flavorful.  "From the Grove" veggie panini is great! Love the grilled veggies with goat cheese - lots of natural flavors from the squash and peppers.

Inside can be loud but l love the decor and neighborhood feel of this little eatery.  Would recommend anyone give it a try. Note peak hours are very busy - go early or late if possible.
Great spot for the area. Comfy and warm with a great patio and good energy. The food was fine. Pizza could have been warmer and the mac and cheese balls were a little bland although the dipping sauce was yummy. The issue here is service. It is very slow and not very attentive. I had to ask a busser for an iced tea refill. Once the food was delivered we never saw our server again until it was time for the check. We were asked 3 times by three different people if we would like our dishes cleared said yes please all 3 times but none of them ever cleared them. Odd.
PLEASE MANAGEMENT, work on making sure that food is delivered in a timely manner. Having to wait for dinner with kids is not fun as much as we love our children.

We ordered the mac and cheese balls, they were really good. So was the bean soup (very tasty) however, here comes the bad news. The Cesar salad was awful, it came with dressing on it however it seemed so dry. I asked for extra dressing, I was given an ounce of dressing, not enough to make a difference in the taste. The chicken in it was dry and was cut into big chunks, wasn't sure if i was eating the croutons of chicken. Maybe slice the chicken instead of chopping them up in big bite size pieces? Also, please when you deliver food to a table, make sure you give your customers forks and spoons. Please? Having to wait to eat your salad because you are not given forks, SUCKS.  

My mom ordered the kale salad was good but was over charged by 3 dollars when we received the bill. Bummer. Glad we caught it.

Burgers were too salty, the kids ate the fries, not the burgers. Waste of food.

Kids mac and cheese is da bomb. Yes, I ate off my daughters plate because my salad was yucky.

My sister ordered a pizza but it looked under cooked, blah. I didn't even want to try it.

Desserts are wonderful!!! Cheesecake is amazing as is the bread pudding.

Please work on cleaning up the menu! This place can be a great neighborhood joint but your restaurant decor is FOR SURE is outshining your food.

Will I come back? Probably not......not until I see Yelp reviews stating the places has changed for the better.

I hate these kind of reviews but someone needs to tell Modern Grove that their food isn't so "modern" at this point. Could have cooked it at home kind of meal.

Our waiter was AWESOME though!!!!!! I forgot his name but he did great.
My husband and I were so excited to see a trendy and family friendly restaurant pop up near our neighborhood we couldn't wait to try! We gushed over the decor for the entire time it took to get our wine (15 mins) which was sub par and room temperature. The menu was good, but only if you were on a "cheat day".  We ordered the only 3 healthy options on the menu and were VERY disappointed. The hummus app was the smallest portion of hummus we've ever encountered, but the stale pita chips were enough for a portion 10x the size.  My Caprese salad didn't feel fresh and his garden salad was blah.  Again we pondered, "maybe we ordered wrong" but come on, you shouldn't have ANYTHING on your menu if you don"t stand behind it.  It was so disappointing that WE WENT TO ANOTHER RESTAURANT  AFTER ON A WORK DAY THAT CRAZY!!!    This place makes me soooooo sad because its the first trendy thing within 7 miles of our house! PLEASE PLAESE FIX THIS WE WILL BE REGULARS!
The staff nice & helpful for the most part. The Hail Kale salad was very very tasty & side potato salad with sweet & red potatoes was tasty too. I would go back again & maybe have some of their beer selection.
First time here at this neighborhood joint....love the open air decor.....we sat at the bar and it was perfect....Tyler was very hospitable by giving us tasters of beer on tap and informative of the menue....I had the Kale Salad and Grilled Cheese with very tasty Fries......definitely will return to this place:-)
I have given this place four tries two lunch one dinner one brunch on Sunday and all failed in the food department. The first two times service at outdoor tables was awful. Extremely slow service. Refills were impossible and they were taking away plates before people were finished eating. Pretzels dry, salads wilted and sandwich my friend had was on dry bun and over cooked.  I blamed all this on the fact they had only been open a few weeks. Next two visits I sat deliberately up at the bar so i could eliminate the table service. The bartenders I have encountered are all very sweet and attentive but food quality still was terrible. Hummus had no flavor. I asked for veggies substitute instead of bread and it was like I asked them to make me a Big Mac. The pizza my friend ordered was under done and the crust was still white. I opted to forgo dinner and drank a glass of wine. My last trip was from this past Sunday. I went alone for morning brunch. My quiche (you can see in pic) had a browned top and a raw bottom crust. Eggs were cold and even watery and undercooked in center. What a bummer. This place is literally one min from my house and I would have given them regular business. Giving up until I read consistent good reviews.
This is an excellent addition to the area.  Its a great indoor/outdoor space with a very relaxed atmosphere.  Actually, I think its a little too relaxed.  My family was greeted right away upon entering and were given a table outside.  It was seriously 10 minutes before anybody even noticed us to take a drink order or at least say hi.  It wasn't even that busy (5:45pm on a Tuesday) so it was odd.  My wife lost the coin toss so she had to walk inside to ask wtf the deal was.  They sent one of the bus boys to take our drink order which finally came 10 minutes after that.  Our actual waitress was very very nice but that was about it.  Our appetizers came out 30 seconds before our entree which didn't even matter because we didn't have any silverware.  I lost the coin toss on that one so I had to walk inside to steal some off another table.

I have to say though, this place does have the food going for it at least.

*  wedge salad = excellent.  One of the best I've had.  The reduced balsamic was a nice touch as was the plentiful bacon
* fried mac n' cheese balls = omg so good.  and that dipping sauce..holy cow I just had a heart attack
* burgers = very good burgers for a bar type place
* peach iced tea = gross...I normally don't Yelp ice tea but this was awful

Anyway, I will be back.  I like the atmosphere and the food was good.  The happy hour specials were decent too but I didn't get to take advantage because my family was invisible for 15 minutes to a waitress.
This place was all right. Other reviews likened their first impression of Modern Grove to a "second tier Fox concept," and now that I've spent a meal there I pretty much agree.

We came here for a late-ish (1:45 - 2:00) lunch on a sunny (and windy!) Saturday. I was surprised that pretty much all the lawn tables and seating were full, given how gusty it was outside. The big garage-door window wall was up and there is tons of natural light in the space, so we got to have some of the effects of outdoor seating without my hair turning into a nest and our napkins flying around. Score! Another score: didn't have to worry about being bombarded by one of the many children flinging beanbags at each other and running around the front door. Hey, there parents were too busy drinking beer to keep their kids in check. Give them a break. *eyeroll*

Service at lunch time was order at the counter, fill your own drink, take your number to the table style. I appreciated that the girl at the "host" station asked each incoming party if they'd been there before (most had not) and explained the set up. It's just nice.

We ordered the hummus to share, while I took the veggie panini and boyfriend opted for the turkey burger. The hummus and my sandwich came out at the same time; turkey burger took about 5 more minutes. Not a huge deal, since boyfriend was in the process of ordering us drinks at the bar and the amount of time he waited for those two drinks took laughably long. There was a guy at behind the bar with his back to the inside room, reading over some notebook/menu who WOULD NOT turn around. Finally another girl came over and took his order for a beer and mimosa. Again, it took FOREVER for her to give him the tab and then pick up his card and run it. Maybe she was in the weeds, but it really wasn't that busy?

Onto the important stuff: FOOD. The hummus was delish, and I liked the pita crackers it was served with. I really enjoyed the feta/olive/herb oil melange poured on top of the hummus. Veggie panini was standard. I really loved the grilly flavor of the veggies, I just wish they would think outside the box. All I could discern was grilled onions, zucchini and red peppers, with the same standard-blah balsamic glaze. Mix it up! I got a fruit cup for my side, which was a typical mix. (Grapes, pineapple, melons)

Boyfriend said his turkey burger was one of the best he'd ever had, and it looked great. There was a good portion of avocado on top of the patty, none of this "here's a microscopic sliver of avo for $1.00" business to be found. His fries were thin and seasoned. Great!

I found out my boss had tried this place for dinner and had a disastrous wait time. Between her experience and many reviews on Yelp, I think our future game plan for Modern Grove will be: 1) stick to an "off" time, 2) try a different vegetarian option (the pizzas looked pretty dang good; the bruschetta assortment looked a little wimpy for $10) 3) attempt to kidnap a child and see how far away I can get before their drinking parents notice. Hooray!
Service and execution need help. On our third visit to modern grove the kitchen was a disaster. Sandwiches came out looking beautiful until you turned it over to discover the bottom was black. Asked for a replacement grilled cheese which they graciously supplied. Unfortunately, the cheese was not melted?

For a group of six, kitchen sent out 2 meals, several minutes later came next 3 meals. Last person was served 10 minutes later than the rest of the party. Steak sandwich was served rare not by request. 

Embarrassing that service is so hit or miss. Get your act together and I'll be back!
I'm totally disappointed, i wanted to like the place, the menu looks good, but I'm not coming back any time soon.

first the lady a the counter was very nice (you order an pay first) I ordered a to go wedge salad, it took over 15 minutes to get it... really? finally i get up and see if somebody know anything about my salad, the lady who took the order saw me and knew right away they had messed up. again she was very nice offering cutlery and stuff but i just needed to leave.

i opened my salad and it looked like it had been sitting outside a few minutes, with a LOT of creamy dressing and a very strong mayo flavor, i like mayo, but not on my wedge salad, who puts mayo on a "ranch" dressing??
second, why wont you list your wedge salad under salads, but under starters? it didn't make sense...
the bacon tasted a little burnt, i couldn't even taste the bruschetta tomatoes...

The whole place looks disoriented, a couple looking for a "waiter", another person asking for ranch at the counter, people didn't know where to order, etc.
and the place is a little loud, the decor is nice, open modern, but that is it....
I live in the area and drive by all the time.  I had wanted to try it for a few weeks.  I went today with my daughter who was in town visiting.  She was not that impressed and I must say that I expected much more.  It was a cute vibe and certainly has a style that is inviting.  I got in the wrong ordering lane and was re-directed right away by a hostess type person.  I don't like making decisions at a new place while waiting in a long line and then feeling rushed when its my turn.  I will do better next time!  Yes, I would go back.  The food was nice, but I wasn't blown away.  I got the hamburger and my daughter got a tuna sandwich.  I think I will try some of the other items on the menu as I really think it looks like there are some good items to try.  Also, they make everything to order and special dietary concerns.  Nice!!!  Another issue with the place is the parking.  There is a side lot, but whenever I'm in this lot, there is usually a semi or a delivery truck blocking the back and it causes a major traffic jam.  There was a line of cars trying to find a spot and there were none.  They have to figure it out because everything in this little strip is popular and everyone is looking for a spot.  (Dunkin Donuts, Firehouse Subs, Nail salon, and Edible Arrangements).  Full Service is in the evening and daytime is self serve.  There were lots of young children in the restaurant while I was there, but that was not a problem at all.  I've now been back about five times and have one additional comment. The service is bad. Drink refills, condiments, and basic service is MIA. If you need something, ask a bus boy. They hustle and will help you. The servers haven't learned basic skills of how to take care of their tables.
I really wanted to like this place since it's in our neighborhood, but we've now been there for both brunch & dinner and were disappointed both times. The atmosphere is so cute and the patio set up is great. However the food is terrible. We were with a party of 5 for dinner, and all of us thought our food was just blah. Then my husband & I went for brunch, and both did not like our meals then either. I hope they improve their food! I really want to like this place.
We had a steak panini and the grill chicken panini, nothing special. Just a regular panini. 

The place looks really good, would be a nice to sit outside and have a beer. But not my style of food.
I had such high hopes.  The patio is fantastic.  The interior is gorgeous and hip and to the other extreme the food is so boring and tasteless.  My pizza (I posted a pic) prosciutto arugula, the crust was bland and looked parbaked.  Table was dirty.  Staff appeared to be annoyed by patrons.  We ordered cheesecake and was told it comes with a cranberry sauce on top.  In actuality it's blueberries.  Also the dessert took between 15-20 minutes for it to arrive...  For cheesecake.  Huh?  I think it was defrosting.  Who knows.  I don't have any plans returning for lunch or dinner.  Maybe the breakfast would be a better choice.  We shall see....
I have no idea what people are talking about... So far the past two times I have eaten here, it's been great! The employees here are always so kind. I received me food in a timely fashion, less then 15 minutes, and it tasted spectacular! I've had the Shrooms Burger and Margarita Pizza so far and highly recommend it. I also love ordering their tropical green tea. Thank you Modern Grove, I'll be back.
I won't be going back. I've been there twice now for dinner. The first time we had to wait for chairs to be found for an available table outside. I wanted that table because it was the furthest from the speakers. The music is LOUD! The second time we sat inside and we had to lean so far forward to hear each other. 

Service there leaves something to be desired. When we first entered the restaurant  there were 3 young ladies at the hostess stand, 2 with their backs to us. No one looked as we arrived or greeted us. I had to get their attention to be seated.

 Both times we had to wait for silverware and flag down our waitress for our check and once because our order was wrong. No one came by to ask how we were doing. I watched as someone at two other tables got up to find out where their food was. It looked like our waitress had tables all over the place both inside and out. The only person smiling was a very confused bartender unsure how to make a drink, but was laughing about it. 

We ordered salads and it took over 20 minutes to get our food. We asked for a mixed French fry order to go and did not get it. AGAIN we had to flag down a waitress. She brought us the wrong french fries. And when we brought that to her attention not a word was said.  She just picked up the bag and walked away. About 10 minutes later she came back with the other type of fries thrown into the bag on top of the other ones and they were burnt. 
We brought this to the attention of the manager since I am a business owner and would like to know when something wasn't right. He also did not say a word.

The food otherwise was ok. Not worth the other inconveniences.
Ok,  I hate to pile on to this place.  It has SOOO MUCH potential and the whole area wants them to succeed!  The restaurant itself is really nice inside and out and the concept seems like it would be a lot of fun but.... It's not.  

The service is slow and seems confused.  They food is well.. just blah.  I have been there twice and it is the only time in years of eating out that I have felt the need to add salt and pepper to my dishes, BOTH TIMES!  There are way too many really good places to eat just minutes from this restaurant for about the same price.  Also, what is with the truck Trailer(s) in your parking lot.  It's not a big lot in the first place.  

Ok so enough bashing.  You have a great concept and a great looking restaurant.  Figure out your kitchen so food comes out timely.  Tweek your recipes so the food had a lot more flavor.  (We put up with "True Food" portion sizes only because the food is pact with flavor.) Organize your servers and wait staff so it is more efficient and organized (you may think it's organized but it doesn't seem like it or look like it.) Finally, if you want it to be a neighborhood hang give us a GREAT Happy Hour! Good drink and appetizer specials and a cheap kick-butt Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's on the weekends.  I really hope you guys get it together because you could be a lot of fun!

Oh and fix your water in the bathroom hot is always on the left!
Ok if you want a quick, inexpensive meal and are ok with bad service.  On multiple occasions I ordered a salad which took almost 30 minutes (the wedge).  On 2 occasions they "lost the ticket" on the food and didn't take the initiative to consider it belonged to a table.  What do you expect when you're being served by high school students and 19 yr olds serving beer?  I'd rather pay more for good service.

I've been here about a dozen times at all times of the day .. Service has been bad every single time.  The wifi doesn't work, and has never worked, and the waiters and bartenders have no customer service skills.  I honestly don't know why I keep coming back other than it's close to my house.
First time to visit this new restaurant in my neighborhood.  I arrived about 820 a.m. on a Friday and noticed right away how attractive the restaurant is. High ceiling; Walls of windows/doors (open to morning's cool breeze); Nice bar area; and Music (although a little too loud). 

Ordering is done at the counter and menus are displayed on walls; easy to read. There were two women ordering and one gentleman ahead of me.  It took more than five minutes for me to order. The woman at the counter was very pleasant and I ordered the breakfast burrito. When the food arrived, it was tasty and I requested additional salsa which they provided. I thought the wait time was a bit longer than I expected (more than 6 minutes - for a breakfast burrito)

Seats are very uncomfortable (small, metal) but the open air concept is nice. 

I will be back with friends for dinner (I'm sure it'll be leisurely...) and I do hope the management reads these reviews and takes action. As a small business owner, I want to support local, neighborhood places. It's an attractive place and the menu appears tasty.  

(What's with the semi trucks in the parking lot running their generators - huh?)
Cool restaurant great neighborhood concept but the food is so bland. Store bought chips for the dips. Kids Mac and cheese is gritty and flavorless. Chicken in salad is over cooked and not seasoned. Heaping pile of raw arugula on my pizza. Salt is great resource. Thanks but no thanks not again
My husband and I were excited when Modern Grove opened, we live near by. We've been there 3 times. # 1 beers are NOT cold. #2 service is slow and often have to look for your server #3 wait time for food seems a little too long. We have always been able to get a seat without having to wait. We have been disappointed with them. We will not go back until we have heard better reviews.  I  hope the management  looks at these reviews and attempts to make changes.
Great Breakfast this morning Eggs Beacon and Hash browns  done just right! Thanks to the cook grilling to order.
Food is good. 

Problem - we are here at 8pm and the interior is lit up like an operating room. Want a glass of wine and relaxation - why do we need 450 watt lights?? 

Seats are uncomfortable.
This place has so much potential but falls flat. I ordered a chicken panini and had one bite. The chicken was dry and the panini bread was horrible. The only thing I ate off my plate was the fruit. I ordered a mimosa and basically got an oj with a splash of champagne. 
The staff seems confused about everything and are all running in a million directions.
Aaaaand the hat stand in the bathroom looks ridiculous.
Positive and negatives to this new place:
Positives: fun, clean, friendly service, and good prices.
Negatives: uncomfortable seats, chef has a heavy hand with the salt (specifically the Mac and cheese balls/french fries), bacon is TOO smokey whoa, and the potato salad came as a surprise when it was made with sweet potatoes and really tasted and had the same consistency as baby food.
***Only reason for the second star is due to the decor, this place is SO cute.

Sunday night, the man and I wanted a small bite to eat and have seen some check-in's here so we decide to check it out. Menu online looks great, a few things right up my ally that I would like to try! (Including fresh mozzarella, I'm obsessed with it)

The evening started with "What do you want to drink?" We order two beers and are followed by "we're out of that..." Needless to say, not a great start. We decided on mac and cheese bites and a wedge salad for our starters. 20+ minutes go by, and our mac and cheese bites arrive, no wedge in site! Another 5-10 minutes rolls around, low and behold, the wedge finally arrives.

I am a big salad fan. In all my years of eating out and watching the food network, I have never once seen a wedge salad COVERED with ranch AND a balsamic glaze. This is a big "culinary faux pas" in my opinion... I ordered a chicken panini and my boyfriend decides on a roast panini...

Sandwiches arrive about 2 mins later, right after our apps were set down, and I can't even begin to explain how bad these things were. I'm talking cardboard bread, bagged/dry/bland chicken with maybe one speck of fresh mozz and a teeeeny bit of the pesto sauce. The roast sandwich comes with about 2 well done+++++ pieces of steak and a few onions. Fries were over salty, and the potato salad my boyfriend order (which was supposed to be pasta salad, but we figured we would deal) was like a tasteless lump of "stuff"... Service is big for me, seeing as we both work in the restaurant industry, I've never seen such a young, immature staff... High schoolers serving you, eating food at the table in the corner in plain site. As we were leaving, we even saw the teenage manager walk out to text on his cell phone.

This was a pretty big bummer, I had high hopes for this place, and made the drive from Tempe to try it out. Like I said before, great decor, and has a great potential to succeed, but they need a serious staff AND menu wake up call... We unfortunately will not be back. :(
I hate to bash a place that I want to succeed, but after 3 visits this will be my last.   All three times my wife and I visited we never received our appetizers.  The first time we chalked it up as a new spot, but the next 2 times we chalked it up as just bad service and a confused staff.   We also received our dinner plates separately which is just ridiculous.   I see from other reviews we aren't the only ones experiencing the poor service.  I hope it changes as I like the location and feel of the place, but can't recommend at this time.
I wanted to really like this place. My friend took me out to lunch here yesterday and upon first look it's a really cute looking spot. I like the open concept and there is and cute outdoor grass area you can bring your dog to. As far as the food goes it was pretty mediocre for the price. We had the hummus starter and two paninis. The hummus was pretty good but both paninis were very dry and not full of flavor. I would probably give this place another try in the future if I was in the area.
Went there for my birthday and had a great time.  Our server was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. We started with a bruschetta board that was amazing. For dinner a friend and I split a chicken panini and chopped salad.  The salad was terrific but the sandwich was just ok.  We played a couple of games of cornhole and just had a fun evening.
This place has a really great atmosphere. It's perfect for dinner bc the food is delicious and reasonably priced. Their customer service is amazing and everyone is so nice and friendly. Definitely coming back here
If you like waiting for absurd amounts of time for gross food this is your place. We came here with our baby and waited a total of an hour and 15 minutes to not receive our appetizer or my meal. The beers were good and waiter was nice. They brought us out the Mac and cheese bites as an apology for our wait and they were extremely bland AND there was no salt in sight. The horror!!!Our appetizer (which was caprese and should have been fast to make) never came. My husband's sandwich was okay and came at 45 minutes. While I waited... We finally gave up and they brought us our bill. I complained and the manager comped our meal and brought me the bruschetta to take home in the 9th hour. It was dry, small, unappetizing and I threw it away after picking at it. 

Recommendation to management- make better food and deliver on time. Your menu is original, ambiance and concept is good and the neighborhood needs your type of restaurant. Go to the vig, le grande orange, and Postinos- take notes and copy their recipes.
Gave the new place a try last night with my husband and we were not overly impressed. 

Negatives: Like many other reviews, the seating was uncomfortable. My husband's hamburger patty was super thin. You could barely see it under all the lettuce and bun. Mac-n-Cheese balls were bland. 

Positives: The staff was friendly, atmosphere was inviting and our food came out quick considering the place was packed. 

Because this place is new, I'm willing to give it a second chance. I'd like to try the panini or breakfast.
The place is really cute and has a really nice outdoor area to include a bar. Went for lunch and sat outside on the artificial turf.  The lights strung up outside I'm sure will provide great atmosphere at night. The food was good, but noting spectacular. I had a garden salad and the other people in my group had a chicken panini sandwich in which the chicken was dry and a strawberry salad where the strawberries were mushy. I could look past all of that, but the thing that got me is how slooooowwww the service is. We ordered fairly quickly and the it took forever for the food to come out. I hope that they get it figured out and pick up the pace because this place has potential, especially in a neighborhood that lacks these cute, trendy places.
Just tried the new little cafe. Reminds me of a cross between LGO and Postino-just not as good. It's nice though to have an option like that close by instead of driving to Arcadia. We will definitely go back.
I'm happy to have a cute place like this to enjoy happy hour in North Phoenix. The happy hour prices are extremely reasonable, especially if you're wanting to drown out the memories of your work day with 32-ounces of beer. The bruschetta was tasty, but the pieces were so teeny. The Mac n Cheese balls were crunchy and creamy, but you definitely need the dipping sauce with them, they don't stand alone well. The basic chips and salsa was satisfying, the salsa being sweet. 
I love the outdoor space with the fake grass, it's fun to sit and enjoy the outdoor area. The service is slow and mostly inattentive, but friendly. Not sure if that is because of the actual servers or because the place is new.
Overall - it's a trendy and causal atmosphere to enjoy a cheap happy hour, nothing gourmet or revolutionary about it.
Great service! And great food! Michelle and Rachael behind the bar made our experience even better! The food was outstanding! Love this place! They have a great wrap around  patio perfect to bring your pet!! Fireplace. Outdoor & indoor bar seating! A must try!
cute neighborhood place BUT we were handed a happy hour menu (Friday 4pm) and ordered several items from it... all great BUT when bill came and i noted the difference she said "this is Monday thru Thursday"..... ummmmm why is hostess handing me a hh menu???? watch out!
Went there last week not expecting much as my husband's been there twice and was very disappointed in the quality of the food. The ambience is very modern and cute but I agree with him the food was not good. I had the grilled chicken panini with sweet potato fries. The chicken was terribly dry, there was hardly any sauce and lots of red onions. I could only eat a quarter of it. The sweet potato fries were ok. My friend ordered the steak sandwich which she also said was terrible. I don't plan on coming back here again. Service was pretty good but the food was just abysmal.
Just found this place!  Open air, great sandwiches, good drink prices, and DOG FRIENDLY.   Love it so far
Modern grove is a local restaurant tocated at Tatum and Greenway. This place specializes in home grown , organic local choices ranging from pizza to salads. One of my favorites is the turkey burger. Its served with your choices of vegetables ; but what's best is that its extremely juicy. Great selection of beer and wines too.
OMG, this is my new favorite place! It was so nice to get a modern, fun, great food restaurant in the neighborhood. My husband and I love going for lunch and happy hour. The atmosphere is so cute and the $5.99 pizzas on Tuesday is such a fun idea. We continue to bring our friends and come back!

A couple of items we love are the bruschetta boards and the margarita pizza! I definitely recommend it!!!
We came in for a late night meal. This place is awesome the food was good. The service was very fast. We even got some free pastries for being the last customer. Normally the waiters and the staff hate the end of day people but they are great!
Great Cubano Panino -Paninis hot seasoned fries Yummy busy place 70 people dining in tonight at 7 pm Great  Bartender -Tyler stays on top of your order.
Ok. Recap two months later. My wife and I revisited. Service and employee attitudes have greatly improved. We will come back.
Blech.  I was really hoping to enjoy this place since Its so close to home.  The interior is very clean and fresh looking and the employees seemed nice enough.  The food however was abysmal.

I got a chicken caesar salad and a cubano panini.  Whatever chicken they used in the caesar sincerely made me sick to my stomach.  It was borderline rancid.  I would have preferred one of those ready kit salads you can buy at a grocery store.   The cubano panini was basically just mustard with slivers of meat on panini bread.  That's all it tasted like, mustard bread.  

If it weren't for the rancid chicken in the salad I would chalk it off to maybe a poor choice in sandwich and forgo the salad if I were to give it another shot.  Its highly unlikely though.
This was my second trip in and I was hoping for better.  I had the cubano panini and could barely eat it.  First off when it arrived it looked sloppy...you know the bread didn't line up ..like it was thrown together.  It was heavy on the mustard and pickles.  So much that I couldn't taste anything else.  I don't think the bread was very fresh either.  It just didn't have that grilled, spongey panini goodness.  I should have skipped the sweet potato fries.  They were soggy and limp.  My husband had the regular fries and they were much better.  But his turkey and cheddar panini also left him disappointed.  The atmosphere for dinner was very noisy.  We were stuffed onto a bench next to a couple having words.  But it was just too noisy for them to argue effectively.  I think Modern Grove has potential but they need to start watching what comes out of the kitchen.
I decided to give it one more try to see if Modern Grove could redeem themselves.  Unfortunately, they did not.  My wife and I waited, and waited, and waited for about 15 minutes.  We thought they should come to our table very soon.  Another group came in, was seated, had their drinks and we were still waiting.  We finally got up to leave and the waiter came over and said hi.  I told him we were leaving as we had been here too long.  He could care less as he just walked off without any apology or explanation.  I would give this place a minus 5 if I could.  I will not waste my money at this place as this time was worst than the last.  I do not remember ever going somewhere to eat and not being served at all.  Worst service of all time.
This place is ok for happy hour.  Both of the bartenders were very nice and helpful.  I looked at their happy hour menu online ( I always do some research before I go to a new place) and saw that the prices for wine was $3.99 a glass from 3-6pm.  I even called the location to verify that the online prices were up to date.   I was told that they were and I went to meet a friend after work.  When we got there, the happy hour prices were VERY different.  The prices were $5-$9 a glass.  I asked the bartender about it and he said that their prices have gone up.   Not his fault- but definitely not what I was told over the phone.
So whatever, I ordered a beer and it was good.  My friend ordered the Pinot Grigio and it was pretty terrible.     The malbec  wine she had next was better.  The bruchetta was good.  We mixed 3 different kinds.  We also ordered a margherita pizza which I liked ($5.99 happy hour  $10.99 reg price) but if I had paid $11 bucks, I might not have.   The seats are all metal and after sitting for an hour ,my rump was sore.  Annoying, after a long day at work and all you want to do is relax and be comfortable.  The bathrooms are unisex, which I did not know so I kinda freaked out when I walked into the bathroom and saw a urinal.  I ran back out and double checked that I was in the right place....

I want to give this place 3 stars but I can't justify it.  2 stars for employees being super nice and attentive.
First try at this restaurant and deeply disappointed.  The restaurant is vey cool, relaxed and our server was very nice.  However, it was possibly the worst Panini I have ever eaten.  My friend and I ordered the 4_cheese.  Bread was unusually stale, cardboard-tasting and there was hardy any cheese.  Not a single grill mark....just boring, hard bread.  The couple who joined us were very disappointed in their chicken Panini .  Same stale, hard bread and process-tasting chicken.  We need a great restaurant in the area, so the place needs to fix their food quality or I can't see any reason for any one to return.  So if the management is reading this, listen up...we WANT you to succeed!
Great fresh food. In the evenings it turns into more of a waiter serviced style restaurant. In the afternoons you order at the register.
Very average food. No selection of veggies for salad. The chicken had a funky taste from refrigerating after cooking. Not impressed and won't be returning unfortunately.
Like everyone else, I WANTED to love this place. However I experienced the same issues everyone else did - long waits for food, weird and slow service (they put in my husbands order - he asked for no onions, came out and told us the onions were premixed so he ordered something else, then came back out and said we changed it back to the first item because we were wrong about the onions), and mediocre food. I loved the atmosphere and the decor. 

Luckily, after reading a few reviews, I knew we might be in for a wait, so we came prepared to keep our kids occupied. I will most likely go back in a couple of months and hope that they heed all of these Yelp reviews. If they are able to improve the food quality and the wait/service issues, then this will turn into a 5 start place for sure!
The first impression I had when we walked in was, "Wow, it's loud in here." It reminded me of a cafeteria. They sat the two of us at a tiny round table that had very little room. They had an unlit candle, a tall table number, a flower, and a bottle of water taking up the space (not to mention our water glasses, silverware, and menus). We got prompt service and I ordered a beer (which they didn't have, so I ordered a different one).

We ordered the bruschetta board and when it came the server looked at us, then at the tiny table, and at us again with a puzzled look. We tried to make room for this huge board she had in her hands. We told her she would need one of the two pizza racks in her other hand. She got it figured out and we made a comment about the tiny table. She then offered us tiny plates, we said no because there wasn't any room. We put the flower, candle, and number on the floor just to make room. The bruschetta was average. The best one was the salami pesto.

We ordered our food. My wife had the strawberry chicken salad and I had the bacon cheddar burger. There was nothing exciting about the salad. We asked about the chicken because it had a weird taste. Not a taste like it was bad, but like it was prepackaged and came out of a bag. We got the run around for a while and ended up getting a very vague response that didn't answer our question. The burger had all the flavor and excitement of a frozen "hockey puck" paddy. The fries were good, but I learned later that I could have gotten sweet potato fries but wasn't given the option.

On our way out, we went over to the market area and I watched the kitchen for a bit. What I saw here is the reason I will not go back. The kitchen was a hot mess. The floor was littered with trampled food. The cook was disheveled and did not look professional at all. He was wearing a pair of gloves, but I don't think he understands what the gloves are supposed to do. I watched him prepare a salad (including breaking cheese apart with his hands). Then bend down and open a drawer to get something else out. He grabbed the spatula and flipped a burger. He also grabbed a disgusting looking lid that was covering some vegetables, scooped up the vegetables with his hands, and then put them on someone's plate. He did all this with the same pair of gloves on. The gloves should be used for sanitary purposes, not to keep his hands clean. I never saw him change the gloves or clean his hands.

Overall, we were rather disappointed. Other than the decor, this place was nothing special. We could have stayed home, made the same meal for cheaper, and eaten at a real table.
Modern Grove has all the makings of a great restaurant. It really reminded me of one of Sam Fox's restaurants, like True Food or something. So adorable inside and out. But that just did not make up for the poor quality food. The bruschetta was pretty good, we got the tomato, pesto and salami, and roasted peppers and goat cheese. I liked the latter 2, but the tomato was...meh. I ordered the strawberry chicken salad and there was absolutely nothing special or unique about it. Like other readers, I found the chicken to taste weird. I asked the server where it was cooked (suspected it was a fully cooked frozen patty when they purchased it), and after avoiding me for about 10 mins, I asked again, and she said her cook was on break and she'd have the answer soon. Answer was that they overnight the chicken, and she overemphasized that they keep it in the refrigerator until they use it, or they freeze it before it goes bad. Well whoop de do! Good for you, MG! You refrigerate your meat!! Anyway, things were just not good, and it seems like they cut corners in a lot of places by buying pre-made food items and not really cooking anything from scratch. My husband got the BBQ cheddar burger and the bun was huge but the burger patty was itty bitty. Just because you have a huge bun doesn't fool me on the actual burger size!  Although the fries were tasty :). So overall very disappointed. Don't let Modern Grove fool you into thinking they are fresh or healthy.
OK went back to grab a pastry
In brief, took forever to get served at the counter and the cherry croissant was raw dough in the middle, threw it away.
Would have asked for a refund but was miles away already when I bit into it
UGH

Do not waste your money here...
I've been back several more times. Sad to say that they haven't gotten the service issues fixed. You just need to go and realize that you have to accept what they bring and how they serve it. Condiments that you want and service are just not going to happen. Example: breakfast toast served with no butter or jelly. Server disappears and doesn't return until you beg to get the check.  Asked for salsa with the eggs and also didn't get that. The food was ok but when you pay for a meal out, people tend to want the things that they expected. I agree with others that the tables are too small (chairs too). LOUD most of the time unless you sit outside.
Amazing breakfast!!! The blueberry cheesecake cookie was delicious treat. Owner is so friendly and staff is accommodating! Definitely coming back to try more of their menu!
Been wanting to try this new place and finally got my chance tonight.  We've driven by numerous times since they opened last spring but the crowds always kept us away.  Monday night was quiet and easy to get in.  Unfortunately we just missed Happy Hour (3-6pm) but looks like they have a nice offering with a reduction of price on many tempting appetizers & drinks.  I saw some mighty tasty looking appetizers passing by and I look forward to trying the bruschetta board on a future visit.

We both had sandwiches - I tried the Capri with mozzarella, prosciutto, pesto & roasted peppers on thick sliced honey wheat bread.  There was an insane amount of prosciutto and half a sandwich was more than enough for me.  He had the turkey & cheddar Panini and French fries, neatly consumed and thoroughly enjoyed.  

I liked the atmosphere of this place, kind of hipster but relaxed & comfortable.  In cooler weather it would be nice to dine on their ample patio.  I appreciated the bottle of chilled water promptly delivered when we sat down.  We did not find noise to be a problem here and the server was excellent, all the way from the friendly hostess to our very efficient waiter.    

I noticed quite a few takeout orders being placed and/or picked up.  On Tuesdays they offer $5.99 dinner-plate sized pizza w/ purchase of a beverage.  Yup, I'm already looking at my calendar and planning my return visit.
Buffalo chicken was excellent!  Taco was great and the kids had the mammas. Outside seating was perfect on such a nice day.
We went here for a dinner celebrating our Twin girls birthday.  It was a very nice space, setup similar to a Noodles and Company.  The specialty is mac n' cheese and they have many variations.  

The food was delicious, without a doubt.

The windows were really bright though and we found ourselves sweating from the setting sun pouring into the west facing windows.  The manager told us shades were on the way.

Highly Recommended and we will visit again.
Great lunch spot near Costco and target.  We tried the buffalo chicken as well as momma's Mac & cheese,  both were very good.  Open and airy location and they bring your meals to you if you are dining in.

We will return to try more things including the four cheese melt which I'm told is excellent.
First time I stopped I got it to go.  I opened it as soon as I got to my car and it was Luke warm.  Tasmte wise it was good but I like my macNcheese warmer.  The second time here I had the Popeye with spinach, mushroom and onion.  We ate at a table and everything was piping hot.  Husband had the buffalo chicken and loved it.  He isn't a Mac and cheese type of guy but he said he would ce back.  Three kids had the regular child's Mac and cheese with hi milk, chips and apple slices.  Everyone cleaned their plate except my husband who ordered the papa size Mac and cheese.
Tried this restaurant for the first time tonight. For some reason, we thought it would be similar to Noodles & Company. Our food was okay but it seemed overpriced for the portion size. Probably won't go back.
