My work buddies and I decided to go here on a lark for lunch today since we were craving something outside of the traditional Americana fare, and it was everything I thought it would be (but not more, hence the average number of stars). There were no belly dancers or tarot card readers, both dinner time lures advertised upon entering, since the noon-to-one crowd is generally geared toward the white collar crowd. That eliminated the possibility of a razzle dazzle performance that may have lured another star out of me, leaving the service, ambiance and food to shine on their own.

The service was adequate. Not really much to say either way on that. I did kind of like the fact that the wait staff was all eating there in a family setting and were just finishing up when I arrived. That immediately raised my expectations, since they wouldn't settle for anything nasty. Also, the kitchen was filled with....Turks! Not a single word of Spanish, which is quite an anomaly in the food service business. Again, my expectations raised.

Upon entering, the customer is given the option of sitting at regular or low seating. I highly recommend the latter, as it consists of plush pillows and short stools arranged around round tables. The main dining area is very open air with warm colors and sparse decorations, but it feels more sterile than the environment created in the adjacent rooms. Within these rooms comfortable open booths and pillows, upholstered in dark, rich colors are accented by decorative lighting that could have been bought from a bazaar and transported straight here. The layout of these side rooms adds to the ambiance and present plenty of opportunity for conversation. 

We all ordered lunch specials, which are composed of rice, pita bread, cabbage slaw and a meat of some sort. The lamb that I ordered was a little on the bland side and stringy. It would have done much better stewed than grilled. I would also highly recommend you trade the plain ole white rice for the biriani rice, which is saffron (turmeric?) based with veggie bits and walnuts. It was savory and scrumptious, the exact opposite of the cabbage slaw, which was an odd combination of vinegar, mint and garlic. It was a little pricey for a lunch special, ringing in at $10.95 without beverages, and the dinner specials are even more expensive.

I would come here a second time for the atmosphere, and maybe for the belly dancing, but I would definitely try something else off the menu.
The food I had tonight at Efe's was so good that, even though I'm nowhere near hungry, I can't stop eating my leftovers. 

My dinner companion and I started with the appetizer sampler, which consisted of hummus, baba ganoush, stuffed grape leaves, some wonderful eggplant something (patlican sousli, says the menu), and tabbouleh. Verdict: mixed. I hate tabbouleh so I was not impressed by that. Neither were the grape leaves great - I always think I'll like them but I almost never do. But the patlican sousli was delicious, the hummus was insanely garlicky and wonderful, and the baba ganoush was excellent too, though it did have some sort of hickory taste going on in the background that left me a little puzzled. i think next time I'll stick with just the hummus and the patlican sousli. 

Our main courses were both, like, ridiculously good. I had the doner kabob, which was grilled steak with pita, rice with saffron and walnuts, and cabbage slaw - the steak was perfectly cooked and super flavorful. My companion had the garlic shrimp, which was just outstanding. Everything was seasoned perfectly and the yogurt sauce that came with my meal was divine: yogurt, garlic, mint. I want to start putting that sauce on everything i eat. 

I'll so totally be back. Maybe tomorrow.
I loved your Hummus...
I loved your Pita Bread
I somewhat liked my Spinach Casserole 
But your service needs a lot of help.

1.  My Greyhound was served in a glass with dirt.
2.  There were 4 of us at a table.  2 of my companions got their shish kebab 10 minutes before my friend and I got our meals.  
3.  Our server actually said "Is there anything else you need before I go on my break?"  9pm on a Saturday night no less, you get breaks?

I guess there was also supposed to be a tarot card reader that they advertise, but she hasn't shown up in three-four weeks.  Think she is still coming?  

At least I was with awesome and intelligent people that made my time there a lot of fun...so I wasn't bitter last night.  (even if I was seated hunched over.  The seating is not good for the back.)  Wished I was in the room with the belly dancing (she could have least came into the other room where most people were dining).  My friend was a little upset over that.
When I worked down in Tempe we often used to come here for lunch. Between the group of us we have sampled numerous selections from the menu and it has all been good to excellent.

The atmosphere is also good and the staff are friendly, making it one of my favorite Tempe lunch spots.
Very tasty food but they changed my all time favorite meat dish ever - the Iskender Doner. Its a good dish now but it used to be superb dish. Dont know what happened. The soup is really good.
By far and away one of the best Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurants in Tempe, Efe's has been one of my favorite dinner and lunch spots for years. Everything I have ordered there has been delicious, but the dish I would recommend the most is the Iskender Donnner. It is lamb that has been cooked (to my knowledge) on a spit and then  placed on a bed of tomato yogurt-soaked flatbread. It is amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant to those who enjoy a great atmosphere and even better food.
I had lunch here two days ago, having never stepped foot in a Turkish restaurant before in my life. I'm an adventurous diner. Per my standard, I skipped the menu and ask the very friendly waitress/hostess to make a recommendation. 

She suggested the Iskender Donner, as it is their signature dish. I order the lunch portion and was quite pleased. Lots of great flavor. The sauces were excellent. Nothing at all to complain about. Even the turkish coffee she suggested was nice -- and I'm not much of a coffee drinker!

High marks. I'm really looking forward to returning some evening when the hookas are blazing.
My mom had been trying to take me here for months, but I just never seemed in the mood for Turkish food (whatever that was). But finally, after getting tattooed for two and half hours I was too weak and exhausted to argue (I forgot how draining it is to bear down against pain for so long, whew).

So I show up at the pretty convenient location (on the outer edges of the always busy Trader Joe's/Changing Hands/Walgreens complex) oozing blood out of my shoulder and took the table by the window - suffice to say I was not in the mood for any antics, rude servers or other malarkey. I noticed a raised up area in the corner by the door that had more traditional seating - lower, round tables and a running cushioned booth along the wall, along with lower barrel type seats on the other side - but didn't feel like balancing while I ate since I could barely stand up. When my mom showed up, though, she wanted to move to that area, so we did and I was pleasantly surprised that it was pretty comfy and of sufficient height to not feel awkward.

The server did not aggravate my intolerance in the least. She was authentically Turkish, so much that we had a little trouble understanding her, but she was helpful and patient by way of explaining some of the more unfamiliar dishes (she's prob used to that). Which, by the way, I found were overall similar to entrees and foods that are recognizable if you've ever eaten at Pita Jungle and the like: falafel, hummus, feta, olives, fresh pita, tobouli and stuff that had different names but was similar to spanakopita and yogurt dressing ... all of which were on the Super Sampler, which we ordered to share.

Note: mom is gluten intolerant and could not eat the tobouli here - who knew there was wheat/flour in some tobouli??

Mom sampled a Turkish wine they had on the menu and immediately vetoed it - if you're feeling adventurous and want to get it, get a sample first. They had plenty of other wine and beer on the menu. Not sure about full bar, I was pretty out of it and in no mood for a cocktail. It was a Saturday night, and at about 7, the live entertainment started! A belly dancer complemented the stellar band of traditional instrumentalists. That was sort of tucked into a separate room, so if you're not into it, you can sit far enough away to ignore.

All in all, this place was charming, right down to d√©cor and the authentic servers and entertainment,  and totally unique. That's not a word I ever use, but charming totally sums it up. And, how cool would you look if you took your date here instead of the super trendy Pita Jungle - with free entertainment to boot? Then mosey to Changing Hands to look at books ... perfect date spot indeed.
I've been here a couple of times and the food pushes it to 3.4 stars, but after the other night I am really frustrated with this place. Don't get me wrong, the food is good but we went last night. The waitress who is actually Polish NOT Turkish asked how many people we had. There were six of us, and she said that we should've called ahead to be accommodated. I looked around, and there was only two other tables of people. one table and a couple and the other had three people who were already done eating. A minute later my friend came in who looked like he knew her, so she quickly sat us.

After about 5-8 minutes, she came over and told us that the computer was down and she couldn't serve us because she couldn't do the taxes. We offered to do the tax on our phones and pay in cash. She just shrugged and walked off. We waited about 7 more minutes to come back. In the meantime she served the other table and threw their plates on the table (they made loud noises it was so hard). Then eventually my friend who said he thought he knew her, went over to see if we could order now. She came immediately to our table, told us the computer was down and she would not serve and that we should leave now. Then she walked away without saying anything.

As I said, I've been here 4 times and the place use to get a 4 (had I reviewed it then), but after being told to leave I DOUBT I will go back anytime soon.
I can't attest for the bad service, but I could see that happening, they're severely understaffed and those that work there seem young. That being said, I will give the 4 stars on their food and ambiance, really the food is 4 star food for the price point in my book.

I don't know if I've just not had Turkish, but the food here is awesome.  Everything is recognizable on the menu: schwarma, lamb shank, hummus, falafel, etc... but when it comes there is always a deliciously different taste to the food.

The baba ganoush is smokey, the falafel is served with a oniony cucumber sauce, and on and on...

Give this a shot.  Strong, yummy flavors in a relaxing, causal environment. Come early for good service?  Dunno.
I've been here twice so far and have had excellent service both times... 
The food here is divine. I'm normally not a fan of lamb, but Efe's really knows what they're doing with it - fall-off-the-bone tender with no hint of gaminess whatsoever. Falafel and hummus are excellent, but standard. Lemony chicken soup was flavorful and creamy but not heavy. Apple tea was a little sweet for me, but I would recommend it - iced or hot. Even the rice is amazing, as are the beef dishes, and I love the slaw with mint. Portions are huge. 
I'm docking a star as the music, while live, is louder than fcuk.
Unique place that you wouldn't stop at unless you were recommended.  Seriously, this isn't the type of place you drive by and say 'oh, let's stop there' -- word of mouth is what I'm guessing drives this business.

We were recommended to visit this place by the entertainer for the evening, a belly dancer.  Efes isn't your typical sit-down restaurant -- in fact, you may have to kneel down.  The environment is to set a casual Turkish dinner setting.  If you have a big party, some of you may be sitting on the floor...don't worry, there are plenty of pillows.

The entertainment was good (if you like belly dancing) and the music was interesting.  Our party of 4 opted for the super sampler to start and the Efes mix to share.

I personally like this type of food.  Exotic, full of spices, not your typical meats.  My wife didn't necessarily find it great, but ate some and didn't complain :-).  I think the Doner Kabob was the best.  If you go with a group, the Efes mix was a great way to try a little of everything and was plenty of food for our party of 4.
a bit of a drive for us, but this was well worth it. we met a fellow foodie couple here. they have cool seating, with all the tapestries and low seating, but we opted for a table because i'd gots bad knees. i had a spinach casserole type dish and it was abso-smurfly delic. my girl had another veggie dish was also quite awesome. and the cabbage salad that came on the side was incredible. we also ordered a sampler appetizer and i loved everything on it....a little hummus and a few other items i don't really know because it was all in turkish. i wanted a turkish coffee but the waitress said it was very strong and since i have an early bedtime, i waited on that one. 

great food and our waitress was super attentive...something i've really come to appreciate as i've "matured". 2 entrees, an appetizer for 35 bucks. not bad.....
Due to the bad economy, Efe's has closed. I am so sad!
I really wanted to love this place, since it is run by one of the guys from Efes.

But I couldn't even finish my meal.

First of all, the meat is pre-cooked and microwaved to order. So if you enjoy chewing on tasteless meat for 10 minutes per bite, then you may enjoy this. The price is not cheap enough to forgo proper (and simple) cooking techniques.

The hummus was, however, tasty. Although very familiar. I believe they may have bought it from Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli on 16th street.

The salad that came with my meal was uninspired and I also found what I believe to be a fingernail fragment in it. I don't know. But it was unexpected as it crunched in my mouth.

This place has some potential, but they really need to provide better ingredients and especially better preparation. As is, it's embarrassing to be called Turkish/Middle Eastern food. It's really the McDonald's of the genre.

Also, please. The Mexican hot sauce does not belong in your restaurant, and especially not slathered on your pita bread.
My husband and I are hard core Turkish dining fans - since my hubby is from Turkey.  We were so excited when we found Med Fresh!   The best dish is not even advertised on their menu board - Iskendar.  Crispy pita bread topped with beef doner meat.  A tomato sauce is poured over the top and topped with garlic butter. Dollops of yogurt sauce completes this dish.  It is out of this world!!!!  We have had this in Turkey and it is more delicious than I remembered.  A real treat is the homeade baklava.  

The chicken kabobs are lemony and moist.  The plate comes with rice pilaf, yummy salad, hummus, pickle and pita bread.  I usually split it with my daughter because it is so big.  The chicken doner is a nice treat either on a bed of rice or as a pita wrap.  Salads are generous in size and we love the dressing.  The ingredients are fresh and healthy.  The restaurant is always clean and the owners are very nice and welcoming.  Prices are reasonable especially for the amount of food you get.  The chai (tea) is delightful.  

We have eaten there every few weeks since the place first opened a few years ago and have never had a bad experience!  

**I originally posted in 2008 and we are now half way through 2010 and I can honestly say this place is still one of our favs!
I had never had Turkish food before we went to Med Fresh. It was really good. We have been back twice since! I really love the salad and they have great falafels and hummus. The lentil soup is also super good. Yum!
this place kind of sucks. 


taste super cheap and bland. but they try to make it look nice. 

way too pricey . and the what i assume is the owner is pretty unfriendly ..



go to munchies two blocks down the street ...
Huge thumbs up to this place, i don't understand how 2 of the reviews are so bad? how does one person say the meat is microwaved when its actually cooked infront of you either on the barbaque if its kebob, ect..or on the Big skewer for Shawerma? 

The owners are from Istanbul, Turkey and i have been there myself, their food is very authentic and has a great taste. Turkish food is very similar to Arabic, mid-eastern food and its full of spices and taste, ect...

Their red special secret sauce is incredible and i have not had it before! 

I suggest you try this place!

Also i don't get how the owners are not friendly *although i have heard this before from someone* they are usually very nice to me, i think sometimes if you go at night when only 2 people are working and they are very busy they are a bit tense!

Try this place you will love it, order the Beef Shawerma!!!
This place is kind of a strange mix.  It seems like a take out place, and yet they have pretty nice seating.  It's like they're trying to make it an eat in place, but can't quite get the atmosphere right.

Anyway, the people are very nice and enthusiastic.  They make great food that they obviously take very seriously.  If you've never had Mediterranean food before, this is a good place to pop your cherry.
Med Fresh has all the ambience of a take-out place, but without the cheap prices or speed.

For $10, the chicken was dry, lukewarm, and boring, the hummus was grainy, and the rice was sad. This might have been because I visited after the dinner rush; everything seemed like it had been sitting just a little too long. The pita was good, as was the salad. The sauce was great - I wished there was more! - though I did add some extra hot sauce to it. 

There definitely wasn't a microwave- the food was all laid out, and you could watch them prepare it.

I really wanted to like the owner I met, but he spent the entire time I was there talking to another customer, while customers piled up waiting for food. The guy who took my order and prepared my food was new, and couldn't keep up with everything that needed done. He seemed like a sincerely earnest guy though, so maybe in a few weeks I'll come back and love him.

Two stars for now, but I want to come back and give it more.
I have been here a couple times now.  I can't say that I have seen problems with service either time I was here.  The atmosphere in here is nice enough.  The workers were all smiles, and moved very quickly to get the orders out.  It was busy, but I was still able to find a seat and eat my lunch.

The problem that I had was with the food itself.  It wasn't bad, it was just... bland?  I ordered the Gyro plate, and it wasnt as good as I had hoped.  I have been to other Mediterranean restaurants, and the food seemed to have more flavor to it.  The pita was fine - but the Gyro meat was not very seasoned, and the rice was rather plain.

Maybe I will go back in a few weeks and give it another shot, just to see if things were off when I went these last few times.  It would be good to have tasty gyros near where I work.
Ok, I created an account specifically to reply to some of these idiots who post on here. First of all, no one microwaves the meat at Med Fresh. They cook it right in front of you. Second of all, I am a chef specializing in a fusion of Mediterranean and other cuisines, and they do it right here. 

The food is very authentic. I don't know where "Paul R." went, but the salad is excellent there. Comprising of only romaine lettuce, fresh tomato, red onion and their excellent dressing, it is as simple as a salad needs to be without missing out on ingredients (and taste). What crunched in his mouth was probably the fresh produce on the salad. 

There is no Mexican hot sauce on the pita bread, it is a roasted red pepper puree of some sort, and is completely native to the flavors popular in Turkey. Clearly, the previous reviewer Paul either is completely void of any knowledge of food critique, or he is incapable of enjoying a good meal. Whichever of these is true, however, is irrelevant because it is clear that he has no real insight on the great food to be offered at Med Fresh.

The garlic/horseradish spread is excellent. I personally love the Chicken Kebabs and the rice there as well. I like to take a pita half, spread the garlic spread on it, put some rice and red onion on and top it off with chicken, roll it up and eat it like a mini chicken gyro! This flavor combination is unmatched by many local mediterranean restaurants. 

Don't be scared by some of these reviews, take it from me and I promise that you will not be disappointed. I have been to Med Fresh approximately 10 times and I have never once had a bad experience. Oh and if you're in a hurry, I wouldn't necessarily recommend Med Fresh. It does take some time to get your food, but again, no one is claiming that it's fast food. 

Thanks for reading.
I got a combo plate, and I thought the food was fresh, flavorful, and fulfilling. :)  I mean, I definitely thought some meats were better than others, but it's a personal preference.  The chicken was juicy and well-cooked.  I don't think this place deserves those bad reviews, but check it out for yourself!
Man...I hate myself for not going to Phoenicia Cafe when In Season Deli didn't have there tables set up.  I met up with a gf on Mill and we decided on this place after finding In Season Deli didn't meet our qualifications for girl time.
The poster outside said eat healthy and live longer.  And since I'm always trying to eat healthy, I thought this would be a great place.  So I decided on the small Greek salad and my friend got the hummus with chicken.  I know, not a lot of food, but bike riding in 113 degree weather on a full stomach sucks.  The food came quickly, and that was no small Greek salad!  They also had pita along with the salad, so it looked like a lot of food.  The salad itself looked fresh, but the dressing was overkill.  For being a "healthy" place, a dressing that tastes and looks like mayonnaise all over a salad does not qualify as healthy.  Something was off there.  As for my friend, she said the hummus was bland and no where near Pita Jungle's.  While I don't agree Pita Jungle is the best or most authentic hummus, to each their own.

This place gets a pass from me next time I'm hungry and on Mill.  Off to Phoenicia!
"doner"? I think not.
I gotta say this place is great and WELL worth the money. When in town I frequent this place for lunch on a regular basis. No microwaving for sure! EVERYTHING I have ever eaten there has been made fresh in front of my eyes!!!! Even the soup is heated to order on the stove in a pan!!!! NO microwave! The greek salad is huge and though the dressing is different its good.... This has a definate turkish flair and is awesome and priced right. The hummus and Baba is great. I love the beef donner wrap and load it up with the chili sauce!!! The GF loves the kabobs and Dad usually gets the LARGE and I mean large salad with chicken kabobs.... You cant go wrong
I have been meaning to tell yelpers about this place...But silly me, the yelpers seem to have known about this long before me! You guys are so in the know! 
Well I'm happy to see that everyone loves this place as much as me! I discovered this place when I used to work on Mill ave. Let me tell you it only took one hesitant lunch before I was craving it every night! 
First off...they deliver! For a fat kid on the go, This is always a plus! To find a place that delivers that is neither Chinese or pizza is pretty freakin cool! 
Second...The owners are super nice! They always great you with a smile and work hard to make sure that you are satisfied with your order. It is a little hard to understand them, but it just means the food is authentic. At least I think so! 
And the most important...The food is really good! I love their vegetarian plate and the desert is wonderful! I would choose this place over big fat Greek any day of the week! really beyond good. 
The only bad that dropped it from a 5 to a 4 star...location, location, location. Mill is such a pain in the butt to drive on. and the parking is no better. But I will always brave the crowds of students and snow birds to eat there any day!
Tasty sandwich . When i eat there another time .. I'll rate again. .. for now the sandwich gets a 5 ..
The presentation of this small restaurant isn't much.  The tables and chairs are uncomfortable and are more indicative of a fast food joint.  That's about all that's mediocre about this place though.

The sandwich combo I got was tasty.  I got a Turkish tea that was a unique, pleasant experience.  They have free refills!

I finished my meal and people watched on the patio as I enjoyed my Turkish tea.  It reminded me of drinking Pilsners in Prague last summer.

I'd give this place of try if you live in the area and have never been.  I wouldn't go out of my way just for the food if you're out of town, however.
The MedFresh Turkish Grill has the best mixed plate I've had in years!  The actual dish is called the Mixed Grill and though it's a bit pricey ($12.95) for the common ASU student...for a chubby guy like me who'll pay dearly for a great meal, it's a fucking fantastic deal.

The FRESH in the name holds true to it's veggies and meats alike.  I'm addicted to the place.  They have a fountain drink selection as well as canned and bottled beverages.  They also carry AZ Iced Tea cans...I like the Strawberry Kiwi flavor - beware they do charge $1.99 for the $0.99 can, so if you're picking up the food to go like I do...get your drinks somewhere else.

They have a couple of TVs in there and during the evenings seem to have sports on for the most part.  The staff is very nice and never seem to be in a crappy mood...they always answer my questions and the place is very clean.

If you like Turkish or even like a Greek style food...then you MUST give this place a shot (no..seriously, do it).  They have a nice spicy sauce that isn't quite as hot as some Mexican salsas but it's still damn tasty.

I must mention this...it's a bit out of place, but they have a cool older style Raiders mirror on the wall.  Being a faithful Raiders fan myself...I have to say that it's badass.  It's a very West Coast place.  If I had my own review site...I'd give this place 5 West Sides.
If your looking for some good Mediterranean food I would go here.  They give you a bang for your buck, a chicken kabob platter comes with salad, hummus, and 4 pieces of pita that is amazingly delicious. 

I will definitely come back for a meal to go.  I would even suggest ordering before you go because it takes a bit of time to cook so you know. 

Recommendation: To anyone on mill not going to the bars and is hungry and in the mood for some pretty damn good hummus.
...I ate there yet again.  I cannot get enough of this place...so fucking good!  The Mixed Grill plate is the meal of my choice...I'm seriously addicted.  Someone please save me!
Last day in AZ, and my friend and I were looking for a quick bite to eat before heading toward the airport.  We randomly walked in to Med Fresh Grill because it seemed healthy and wasn't too crowded.  I had the vegetarian plate which came with hummus, baba ganouj, falafel, tabouleh, dolmas, small salad, and pita bread. Wow, I wish I had discovered this place sooner.  The hummus was one of the best hummus that I've had. Creamy, but not too oily, good flavors. Best item on my plate.  I didn't care for the tabouleh, but I liked the dolmas and baba ganouj.  The hummus though really stands out. 

My friend had the chicken pita wrap combo with fries. When they called our number, they only had the fries and forgot the wrap! The guys apologized, but it was still a little annoying since it wasn't crowded. I'm not sure how long we waited for our food, but it wasn't fast.  On the other hand, everything did taste fresh, so I'd rather wait for quality food. 

Parking can be a pain, but the food was definitely worth it. Great find in Tempe. Get the hummus.
For the most part I love Med Fresh. Their salad dressing is amazing, and the meat is great. You can see the meat being roasted, and the food being prepared. Great for vegetarians as well...my friend loved her vegetarian meal. They are very clean, and for the most part very friendly. Wish the prices wouldn't keep going up, however I still keep paying it! Make sure you ask them for the their hot sauce, it not only ads spice to your meal, but a wonderful flavor too!
My husband and I went there recently. We are both from the Mediterranean and absolutely love food. I had the lamb kabob and I loved it. The meat was juicy and tender, perfectly seasoned. Their rice is everything but blend. First bite into it and all the spices hit you at once, definitely worth it. I was a little disappointed in the baba ganoush dish as I expected it to be more like the aydari. My husband totally loved the shawarma, chicken combo and the garlic spread. Though a little bit on the pricey side, it's worth trying it.
I  loveeee the food here! I recommend the chicken wrap. If i could rate JUST the food I would give Med Fresh 5 stars. If you're lookin' for some yummy food at a decent price and don't care so much about the appearance i would say Med Fresh is for you. 

As you may have noticed I tend to rate bathrooms....If a business has a cruddy bathroom it can really bring the rating down a star or two... I don't know about you, but when you use a dirty bathroom in an okay restaurant, it makes you wonder what their Kitchen looks like.

As for Med Fresh....they share bathrooms with other nearby businesses. I wasn't a fan. You had to borrow a key that is on a wooden rod form the front. I was grossed out by the idea of other people holding onto that key after using the restroom. yuck
The food is always fresh and made to order at Med Fresh. The portion sizes are huge which they should be since the prices are a little high. But they pile it on I like the Mixed Grill which includes chicken and some other meat, humus, pita bread, small salad, and rice. This plate usually lasts me for 2 meals but today I was exceptionally hungry and I ate it all gone. The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is always clean.
I am a hummus fiend. I have made tabbouleh so delicious that the heavens parted and rained down tears of joy upon its consumption. I will cut a bitch over the last dollop of garlic dip. Don't even get me started on baba ghanoush.

So it's almost a guarantee that I will like anything that draws upon a Mediterranean flavor palate. 

Med Fresh is no exception.

It's technically Turkish, but I don't split hairs when it comes to Mediterranean. The pitas are fresh and flavorful, the tzatziki is kickin' and the gyro meat (beef and chicken) are always moist and delicious. Everything is prepared as you order it and you have a clear view of the goings-on in the sunken kitchen. The staff can be a bit terse at times but they're always professional and quick to disperse a busy lunch rush. 

The platters are priced well for the mound of food you receive, and while I have had some tonsil-scraping dry chicken on occasion, the majority of the time the kabobs and koftas are moist and tender. If you simply can't be pressed to make up your mind, go with the mixed grill and get a bit of a variety. 

The pita sammich special (#16) is the best bang for your buck on the menu. Pita, meat, tomato, lettuce, weird pickles and secret sauce. Served with tzatziki and their killer spicy red sauce. Salad or fries on the side. $6.95. 

Oh yeah.
The grilled chicken kabobs are my favorite. Every day they make fresh baklava and other desserts. The side salad is tossed in a homemade garlic lemon dressing served with cucumbers and tomatoes. Healthy and yummy. Family owned. Owners are originally from Turkey so the food is very authentic. I have visited Turkey several times and actually prefer the Inskender here to the ones I had in Turkey. As someone else mentioned - this is not on the menu but really worth ordering. Takes time to prepare because there are lots of steps to the dish. Toasted pita bread, then doner, then tomato sauce, then yogurt and finally garlic butter poured over the top. OMG. So good. 

Hummus, veggie options, falafels, fruit smoothies, etc.  Lentil soup is made from scratch and hits the spot. 

Everything is made fresh to order. Love that there is a locally owned healthy eatery near ASU!
My husband and I are hard core Turkish dining fans - my hubby is from Turkey.  We were so excited when we found Med Fresh a few years ago!   The best dish is not even advertised on their menu board - Iskendar.  Crispy pita bread topped with beef doner meat.  A tomato sauce is poured over the top and topped with garlic butter. Dollops of yogurt sauce completes this dish.  It is out of this world!!!!  We have had this in Turkey on  a few trips and I prefer the Med Fresh version.   

The chicken kabobs are lemony and moist.  The plate comes with rice pilaf, yummy salad, hummus, pickle and pita bread.  I usually split it with my daughter because it is so big.  The chicken doner is a nice treat either on a bed of rice or as a pita wrap.  Salads are generous in size and we love the dressing.  The ingredients are fresh and healthy.  The restaurant is always clean and the owners are very nice and welcoming.  Prices are reasonable especially for the amount of food you get.  

A real treat is the homeade baklava.  It is flaky, buttery and made the authentic way - with sugar and not with honey.  The chai (tea) is delightful.  

We have eaten here every few weeks have never had a bad experience!
I have enjoyed Med Fresh each time I've gone.  Their skewered and grilled chicken seems to be what I order the most.  It is always very moist and tasty.  I've also gotten a combo platter that has a little bit of everything and I haven't been disappointed in anything in that either.  Their salad is simple but good.  The pepper spread on the pita is a nice addition as well.  As many others have said, their garlic sauce is very flavorful and is good with just about everything.  

The place is clean and the staff is always friendly and helpful.
Really think this place brings for their cost, speed, quality and location.  Their food is very good and reasonably priced and always cooked fresh upon your order.  The kitchen is extremely clean and makes you feel good about what you are eating.

The chicken is fantastic as is the falafel, salads and hummus.  The fries leave a little to be desired but you really shouldn't be ordering those at a place like this.

This is not a place that you would bring a date to or be looking for a night out.  If you are looking for quality food at slightly higher than Subway prices than this is the place for you.  Also if you haven't had this type of food before this is a great intro to it and unless it is very busy the staff will offer you a sample.
I had a nice lunch there this week. The Lady who took my order seamed extra pleasant. The food was good/ok. I will try again to see if there are any items that are really good. I had heard that the humus? is very good. Maybe I will increase my rating if it is a standout.
I do like their food but sometimes it's only ok.  We orderded our food and it's honestly kind of a mediocre portion.  We sat outside and i believe the owner was smoking even though there was a no smoking sign.  It was pretty obnoxious.  He then went inside and brought our food out...gross.  It's next to my work and it's something different to eat.
A friend recommended Med Fresh's falafel, so I thought I'd give them a try. It was so yummy! Usually you get big falafel balls, so each bite is either all falafel or no falafel. Med Fresh spreads theirs out so there's an even falafel distribution. This is very important. (Is there a Yelp award for using the word "falafel" the most times in one review?)

I went there for lunch to escape the office. Some people feel awkward eating alone, but almost everyone there was enjoying lunch solo. The guy at the register talked me into a strawberry-banana smoothie, which was sweet and tasted fresh.
I love Med Fresh -- their chicken donar, the vegetarian platter, the lentil soup -- all the stuff of dreams. But:

The spinach salad on the new menu is hard to eat. Can there be anything worse? It's tart-on-tart with little relief. And such a shame! You get beautiful perfect spinach with red cabbage, and absolutely gorgeous feta. But it's dressed with balsamic vinegar and (I think) pomegranate juice, with no balancing element to reduce the bite and add another dimension. The effect is to exagerate that sensation you get from raw spinach that all of the surfaces of your mouth have been scoured. It was actually uncomfortable to eat. And expensive! After paying extra for pita, my lunch, with no meat or nuts on it, was over $10 -- no drink. 

Speaking of the bill -- this place is pretty pricey and inching up. It's always crowded, tho, so I guess they know their market. For me it's an occassional treat. 

That said, everything else at/about Med Fresh is wonderful -- hence the 4 stars. Really nice people and amazing, delicious healthy food.

Just don't order that salad!
I looked them up on Yelp! and ordered a take out order based on their website menu.  When I arrived to pick it up both items that I ordered were 2 + dollars more than their own menu.

When I mentioned it to the cashier she was not at all apologetic and did not offer any concession on the price.  No one behind the counter seemed to care that they had just shafted their customer.  They cared even less when I told them that I would most likely NOT be back.

The food was good, although I can get good Mediterranean several other places around town.  My prediction is that there may be a restaurant available on Mill Ave if this is any indication of how much they care about their customers.
I absolutely love this place. We go on occasion for lunch at work and I always get the same thing: The Chicken Doner Plate. The chicken is noms, their hummus is as good as any I've ever had, the garlic paste they give you is delicious (but lethal--don't eat it if you have a meeting later), and their rice is just killer. Only complaint is that it's a little pricey for lunch (which is why we don't go all that often) but it's worth it if you're craving some really good Turkish chow.
Great lunch spot on Mill Ave!  I've had tabbouleh, the chicken salad and the vegetarian plate - all have been spot on.  My co-workers also like the chicken donner and the kebabs.

Two drawbacks, though:  First, it's expensive.  Whenever you add chicken to a salad, they add $3.50, which brings your bill up above $10.  Second, service isn't exactly speedy.  I realize that fresh, quality food isn't cheap and takes some time to make, but I have time constraints and a different price point for a work lunch.  4 stars.
After traveling to 40 different states, and eating in countless Turkish, Greek, Mid Eastern and Mediterranean restaurants, only one place had the best baklava in the US. And none came even close. It was Med Fresh Grill. Baklava was just amazing. To die for. Crispy on the top moist and sweet at the bottom with generous portions of pistachio in the middle.

Even only for the baklava they deserve to be the best. 

The Kebabs are excellent as well, get the mixed kebab plate. Amazing garlic sauce, amazing meat.

I just loved this place, and wished to live in Phoenix just to eat baklava anytime I want from Med Fresh Grill.
If you look at Med Fresh Grill from the outside, you might ask yourself: What is this place?  And right you should: there's outdoor seating, there's "grill" in the name, and behind the fast food style counter, there's bottles of liquor, it's all very confusing.  Med Fresh Grill is a low profile restaurant with high-end turkish food.  Their falafels are moist, and scrumptious.  Their portions are generous, you will NOT leave hungry.

Do not pass this place up.  It is a hidden gem of Tempe.
We stopped in last night before a show at the Gammage looking for a good quick bite to eat.   The waitress was quick to seat us, take our drink orders and recommeded a Turkish pilsner that we decided to try.  My friend recommended the chichen doner, equating it to chicken shawrma, but I still found my self torn between that and the lamb kabob wrap.   
Ordering the chicken doner with a side salad, my friend decided on the falafel plate.    While it took a bit to get the food out, under any other circumstance time would not have been an issue, but since we had to be somewhere and we were hungry it felt a lot longer than I am sure it was in reality.  
My chicken doner was served fresh and  piping hot off the grill  with a side of tzatziki and a spicy tomato based "salsa" and the salad was fresh romaine lettuce, tomatos and cucumbers, drizzled with a rich spicy dressing.    The Chicken doner was seasoned superbly and garnished with pickles and tomatoes.  I enjoyed this much more than the chicken shwarma at Al-Hana.  
My friend's falafel plate looked amazing with a salad, 4 or was it 6 good sized pieces of falafel, hummus and some warm pita. 
The turkish pilsner accompanied the meal well.  
After we were done, the waitress offered hot tea on the house, and had we not had somewhere to be we would have stuck around for some hot tea.  
The service here was excellent and the waitress was very friendly. 

So why 3 stars and not 4 or 5.  Well later in the evening my friend started feeling ill, poor guy.  By the time intermission rolled around he was feeling queezy and by the shows end the guy was hurting. [Don't blame it on the performance...that was pretty good.]  While I was not feeling bad, admittedly he did have a few things on his plate that I didn't have.  I need to check on him this morning.
Tried this place today at the suggestion of a friend and I am so glad that she did!

I had the chicken gyro plate and was very impressed.  The amount of food is quite plentiful; seasoned and sliced chicken gyro meat atop a bed of saffron rice, small side salad, pita wedges, garlic sauce, hummus and their own brand of hot sauce.  Chicken was grilled and sliced perfectly thin.  Garlic sauce packs a punch.  This platter and a large drink came to about $13, but they do have smaller portion options as well.  

I've eaten at a number of Mediterranean places in the area, some have come, gone and/or fallen off my list of places that I care to patronize.  Now that I've discovered MedFresh, I don't miss them at all.

Additional details -- It is in a great location on Mill, within easy walking distance of offices, parking and even light-rail.  The interior is very comfortable and spacious.  The proprietors at the counter are very friendly and happy to have you in their establishment.  Oh, and they serve Coke products!  ++
I used to come here a lot and the food was fantastic.  This place used to be underrated and then all of a sudden it became really popular.  Ever since that happened, the food started to be lower quality and just not taste very good.  I give it 2 stars because it used to be good, but really it should only get 1 now.
This is by far my  most favorite Turkish place. I have been to this place countless number of times and was never disappointed. In fact, now that I don't stay in Tempe anymore, I always make it a point to visit this place whenever I go to Tempe. 

I  love their chicken kabob platter. Chicken skewers are always perfectly marinated and moist. I also love their rice, pita, garlic dip and salad served on the side. I have tried falafel and chicken gyro sandwiches as well and those were pretty good, too. I would highly recommend this place if you happen to be in Tempe downtown.
Some of the best you can get in Phoenix.  Great falaffel & schwarma.  Very consistent.  Always good.
This place is wonderfull!! I eat there at least once a week...the food is flavorfull and delightfull...I have spread the word about med fresh and my friends agree its wonderfull! They never use a microwave and prepare everything in fron of you.

This place isn't fast food so don't compare it to Mcdonalds, it gets the job done and I highly recommend it.
Best Turkish place in town. There food is amazing and the owners are very friendly and warm people. The food is a little bit pricey for an everyday lunch however they get 5 stars for serving Efes Pilsner & consistently being tasty. Can't go wrong with any of their plates!
Med Fresh is delish... Always get the Chicken Kabob .  Our visit last friday was very enjoyable!  The food is cooked fresh and the service is superb.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, the hummus was very creamy.  The salad and dressing was so fresh.  Every flavor on the plate complements each other and to top it off the garlic paste is to die for!  My son had the Beef Gyro and loved it!  All in all this place is great!
AMAZING!  The food is plentiful and always fresh.  I always walk away stuffed with leftovers.  The decor inside is very nice.  The staff is friendly and provides quick service.  Love Med Fresh!
Good food.  Small portions, especially for a Mediterranean joint at the prices they are charging.
sorry have to knock this place down a notch since they charge 50 cents for a water cup... Don't think this is even legal in AZ.  Still great food though!
Good food. Girl is not too friendly  unless your Turkish.
SMALL portions LARGE PRICES! Not enough hummus or babagounish. Veggie platter price keeps going up with all the other prices. Really good food just skimpy on things and prices are very expensive for this kind of fast food.
Liked it lots. I had the mixed grill, that had marinated grilled chicken, grilled steak tips, and a ground meat strip with spices. The accompaniments were a yummy salad with some yogurt dressing, lovely creamy hummus, and a small dollop of creamy roast garlic. They had grilled the pita and used the inside of it to slightly "soak " up the juices from the meats. It was just enough to moisten it, then it was sliced in about 8 pieces. It was fresh, light, perfectly herbed. Just the right thing at night time.
Not really busy like other places
I am Turkish and Med Fresh Grill does not do a good job to represent Turkish food. Their doner (gyro) is not good at all. Their Adana kebap was ok when they started their business but now it is disaster to eat. It was only choice to eat some Turkish food in Valley. Luckily, now, there is a new Turkish restaurant (called as Turkish kitchen on Warner Ave -between Arizona and Alma School Rd in Chandler) opened last week. If you try their food, you can definitely understand how Turkish food should taste. I hope with this  new Turkish restaurant, Med Fresh Grill can reconsider their menu again to find the true essence of Turkish food.
This place is bomb!  I have eaten here several times and have never had a bad experience!  My co-worker suggested My Big Fat Greek, and I drove right past it to get to Med Fresh.  The portions are very generous, and most importantly the food is DE-LISH!  For the price, you get a lot of amazing food.  The chicken kebob is my favorite, and it comes with saffron rice, hummus, salad, tahini and pita bread.  The staff/owners are incredibly nice and will happily chat with you about the food if you ask them questions.  I would say it's not quite a "hole in the wall" but definitely not a chain-gang restaurant.  GIVE THEM A TRY -- You will earn your membership into the "Clean Plate Club" for sure!
Had a falafal pita.
I've had it many times at other places, and let me just say....I've had much better.
Two other people I went with also said their dishes were just ok.
One of them wanted to go there to have the turkish tea, but the lady who took our order said it was too early for them to make tea... mmm, it was past noon.

I wouldn't recommend this place to others.
The food here is some of the best middle eastern / turkish food in the valley. I would go here more often if the prices weren't so high. $16 for a lunch is more than I care to spend everyday.
Wow... so great!
Good portions.
Awesome flavors.
They got it right here!
Amazing falafal ----best falafal I have ever tried & I have had alot! I ordered the Veg Platter & it was all very good. The dolmas were delish & I generally don't like those. The hummus was pretty good (but I like mine the best). The baba was good but needed a tad more salt. The tabouleh was also excellent. All and all a great meal & I will definitely be back.
The food was pretty bad. Enough for me to sign up and write my first review on Yelp.

I was in town for business and wanted some middle-eastern food. Checked Yelp and this place had a good rating.

Inside looked nice and I saw what I wanted which was the Adana (ground beef) kabob. The picture looked tasty. With a drink the total was $15, yes $15!

Got my food and it looked nothing like the picture. Small portion of dry overcooked flavorless beef with a bed of awful Spanish rice and a salad with a little bit of honey Dijon dressing. Hardly authentic or flavorful especially for 15 bucks. I suggest you look elsewhere in town for good kabobs because the food was just plain bad.
This is one of my favorite places on mill. We need to support more local businesses. Although the prices have gone up a bit it's still worth a visit.
The food here is great! The staff is always polite too, which is nice on Mill. 

Within the past year or so they have changed it to a 'sit down, and we come take your order'  style restaurant... I wish they would go back to walking up to the counter style though. The new way seems kind of stuffy for a restaurant on Mill.
There are plenty of places on Mill Ave. to get Mediterranean food, and this small restaurant is one I frequent regularly.    I mostly get my food to go because the atmosphere isn't all that inviting, and as others have stated, the chairs are uncomfortable.

Their hummus and rice are both excellent, and I'm a big fan of their doner kebab meal.

Munchie's has a tastier Gyro combo, but Med Fresh grill has tastier meals.  The rice and the side salad really add to the fullness factor, as I always feel like I've eaten too much.
This place is a lot of fun. We have a large distributor out of Turkey, so we've made many trips to this place and made friends with Yusef, the owner. What a great host! I really like the baclava, but if you're new to Turkish food, just be bold and go for the Adana kabob!
There are many Med options out there, and like one person has noted, there are a handful on Mill that cater this type of food. Unfortunately for the others, this one is the best. Aligning the walls of this establishment are awards for their outstanding service and food. The owner is Turkish and has developed an amazing array of handmade dishes he undoubtedly learned to love in his native country.

I appreciate so many different things about this place. The gyros are great and the food feels fresh, not processed or stale. The salads are good, as is the humus. Being a smaller business, they make their dishes in house, and the processed foods are swept away, making this a quality and enjoyable meal. It might taste different to you, and that's because it is. 

There are many fine Greek restaurants out in the valley that push out amazing dishes, this is not a "fine dining" establishment like others, filled with waiters and high priced side dishes. What Med-Fresh does is  push out amazing food at a good price, and the locals have steadily fell in love with it. I was worried with the economic downturn that this start up might not last, but ASU students and locals have embraced it.. Also, notice all the ethnic and minority groups that frequent this place. Its a very good sign of whether or not its a true-blue restaurant, or non-traditional. I always notice many foreign students sitting and enjoying the food, which assures me that considering where they are at for the time being, this is their best and favorite spot.

Try their Gyros first unless you are a big Med food geek, which in that case you can expand further of course. Start small, then go from there. Enjoy!!!
Far and away the best $10 bucks you can spend on Mill Avenue is the Chicken Kabob plate at Med Fresh!  Everyone I've ever taken here has simply loved it.  The owners are very friendly and treat you like family.
Wow, the chicken was too burned and they charged me $1.99 for grilling the tomatoes and onions but didn't tell me. When I objected they just said, "Oh well." Not for me. There are too many other good Med places in Tempe.
I love Mediterranean food, obviously, for the taste, and also for how guilt-free I feel when eating it because of how healthy and protein-packed it is for a vegetarian like me.

I went to MedFresh Turkish Grill on Mill Avenue, a place I like for its awesomely filling Vegetarian Combo ($8.95). The large plate came with pita bread, hummus, baba ghanouj, tabouleh, dolmas and a Greek salad with homemade Greek dressing I would gladly replace my favorite ranch with any day.

Go there for the food, not the atmosphere, since it's a fast casual, order-at-the-counter type place. It's great for people-watching along Mill, though.
I only had the chicken pita and it was  good.  Not great but better than most of the food on mill.  I would recommend it for a casual or quick bite.
I've hit up the usual "Middle Eastern/Mediterranean" spots in Tempe (We luckily have a quite a few)...and I am so surprised that I have yet to review MedFresh. 

I am enamored. Their hummus is divine, their Gyro plates are sublime. Let's talk about the fact that they have chicken and beef/lamb roasting all day...top that with their delicious red sauce (what the heck is that stuff!?)...and it's pure satisfying delight.

They also give you a little side salad, for a well balanced, complete meal.

Now, what makes them stand out? THE QUALITY. Hands-down. Some other places (which shall remain nameless, you've been there, I've been there...they're open late and you needed some drunk food fixins) serve up the nastiest cuts of chicken/beef/lamb. I rarely eat meat as is...so when I do, I don't want gristly, cold, marbley fat meat.

So here we go...in short, just try it once. What can you really lose? You'll find out it's better than the other spots, for the same price, and suddenly you don't have to eat food, while intoxicated, to appreciate it.

Win, win : )
A friend told us about how great this place was and we decided to give it a try. My boyfriend and myself have over 30 years in resturant and customer service experience and I always take a moment to compliment great service, however this time  I was so incredibly disappointed that I felt it was necessary to speak out about how not only was the food FAIR but the lack of customer service was borderline pathetic.  

The hummus had no flavor, and the pitas were about the same. When we placed our orders, they were out of the three dishes we had inquired about. After about 20 minutes my boyfriend's meal came out and it was cold, I then sat there for 7-10 minutes awaiting for my salad wondering why it was taking forever and as to why you would bring out one meal and not the other with zero explanation. I have had mint salad at other middle eastern restaurants however this was not so amazing, and should really be served as a side dish and not a meal, especially being $9.00 I also asked for chicken to be added which consisted for an additional $4.00 (4 pieces).

The guy who took our order was too busy in conversation with everyone else and never once checked on us, although he was sure to make eye contact with me about 5 times. Eventually, the gal who was working (Brittany) stopped over to fill drinks and see if we needed anything...she was the only positive thing about this experience. 

I expressed my concerns to Brittany who went to tell the owner that we were not happy with the experience and all she can say was sorry sorry sorry and never offered to make things right,  and pushed for us to have "a little dessert to go"...which I did not want. I wanted my "meal" comped which would have been the right thing to do, aside from the apology and to leave. 

The guy who originally took our order came over to apologize and did nothing but give me a list of excuses on why he may have dropped the ball... in which I called him out on, this guy really should look into another profession because customer service was not his strong suit tonight. 

Bottom line, I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are many middle eastern restaurants ASU who have superior service and much better food.
Med fresh owners and cooks smoke in the back of the kitchen. Ummm...illegal much. Whatever happened to health inspectors?
Two words - Grilled fish and Baklava. I am always willing to make the long drive for these two. Located at the heart of Mill Ave, a dinner on the patio with good friends and amazing food. Thats what i mean when i say bliss.
The grilled meats are good but nothing extraordinary.  The side dishes on the combo plates are, for the most part, simple and fresh.  The rice is the low point (bland and falls short of traditional cracked wheat) while the balaclava is the high.  That it is fairly expensive coupled with the inconvenience of parking means I won't go out of my way to eat here again.
I was with my sister on Mill Ave looking for some food to eat. We thought Greek would be awesome but then we saw Crave was gone and My Brg Fat Greek burned down. So we came across MedFresh and decided to give it a go. We both ordered gyros with lamb and beef and some hummus. First of all, the hummus had a strange aftertaste, I decribed it as if there was whiskey or some sort of alcohol in it. It was tolerable to eat but I wouldn't order it again. Then our gyros came out and I didn't like the flavors that came with it. It had too much stuff in it like pickles, lettuce, onions, not sure what I normally have in a gyro but it just didn't taste right. So we left and my plate had half a gyro and a lot of stale fries that I couldn't eat. The staff was very nice and attentive but the food quality will cause me to never return.
My husband and I stumbled upon this place on a Sunday afternoon when we couldn't decide exactly what to eat. Boy were we glad we did! The food was absolutely fantastic - fresh and tasty and the service matched the quality of the food.

We both ordered a lentil soup to start which was pureed - a way I have never had it before - and I can tell you I can't wait to have it again. They included a lemon wedge with the soup which enhanced it's flavor beautifully. We then shared a Vegetarian plate which was plenty of food for two. The hummus and baba ghanouj was some of the best we've ever eaten and the grape leaves were incredibly fresh as well. I am of the opinion that grape leaves can be really hit or miss and can sometimes leave a bitter taste in your mouth - these did nothing of the sort. In particular, the tabbouleh salad was some of the best either of us have ever had as well. Fresh, full of parsley and mint and good to the last drop.

If you're down on Mill - It's a place you must try.
Absolutely delicious lamb kabobs and not too expensive. This place is a legitimate Turkish restaurant.
When my wife and I went, the place wasn't that busy.  We had no problem getting our food and the girl that took our order was nice.  We had the chicken Kabob which if you are new to this type of food you can't go wrong.  They gave me a chili pepper that almost burned my head off, my wife had a good laugh watching me suffer.  We would eat here again, fair price, the decor is nothing to write home about but the food is very tasty
Excellent food! 

The skewered beef was remarkably tender and juicy - better than any other beef I've had in dozens of similar places, some charging double the price.  The chicken was similarly delightful - not dry or tough.  The Koobideh (ground, seasoned beef) was also good, though I'm less of an expert on that.  The 'beef gyro' meat was also good - that's a great array of good meats!  The lamb that I had on a prior visit wasn't quite as perfect, but I'll give it one more try.  

Their platter of Mediterranean delights such as hummus, tabbouleh, etc was also great. 

The only disappointment was their rice - you get a massive serving, but it tasted like Mexican rice (that is, the big pile of rice you get in a typical Mexican restaurant - volume not quantity), not the finer basmati rice I would expect.  I'd like to see a smaller serving of much better rice, personally ...  But this is a minor issue given the quality of the rest of the food. 

We were also seated one night at closing time - the staff stuck around while we ate a meal, which was very good of them.
Great gyros, especially the chicken gyro! I love their tzatziki too. Food is always up quick and the service is good. Their greek side salads are also very tasty.
I am disappoint!

I was come heer for 3 years. Food used to be so gud. Now, food taste go down drain. Vat happen?? Come a few times last month, chikin so so, hummus go down, tatziki vierd taste. Ovner very nice as always, but cheep on food qvality now. I am dissapoint! :( sad face!
Looooove this place! Went here for the first time a few days ago and ordered the lamb kabob pita - addicting. The wait was a little long, which was annoying because I was starving, but when I had that first bite... oh my! Worth every minute of a wait. The tsaziki sauce is served as a side so the sandwich isn't messy. The lamb is cooked exactly the way lamb should be cooked - not too chewy, not burnt, not raw - seasoned, soft and delicious.

My co-worker ordered the Iskandar plate, which she raved about as well. It's located on Mill Avenue but it's tricky to find - you have to park and then walk into a small plaza, then make your way to the back until you see it tucked in the left-hand corner. Go here and enjoy real Mediterranean food!
Good place near the college in Tempe.  Prices are decent and the food is pretty good.  I ordered the Mixed Grill to share with a friend.  It fed both of us with enough to take home.  Although we weren't very hungry to begin with.
Food was good and I enjoyed eating outside!
This place is great for lunch, dinner that's another story.  I have been here multiple times, I feel their entree plates are better than their gyros wraps and sandwiches.  For dinner, this place is a lot more low key and not as many people frequent it.  Overall, I think is great, service could be a little better but the food makes up for it.
What a gem in the middle of the desert. The tabuli salad was excellent. The Adana Kebab, though not as spicy as I like, had good flavor and very moist. Baklava and Turkish coffee to top it all off.
Three hungry girls sick of eating the same old crap, we decided to check this place out since we were nearby. All three of us lived in turkey at one point in our lives so we have all had good Turkish food. Anyway, we got the yogurt drink which was delicious. Two of us got the beef doner plate and one got the chicken doner plate. I think we got the left over scraps because we went late so chicken was dry and the beef was greasy. The salad had a spicy dressing which didnt mesh well. The hummus had little flavor. We expected better pita, but they used the usual arabic pita. I hate that pita. i was hungry but I could finish my plate, it just wasn't good. 

The older gentleman who served us (I think he was the owner) was very polite and personable. I just wish I could have liked his restaurant.
I was just passing through town to get something to eat and I came upon this restaurant. The service is great. Ali and Salda run the whole show and are warm people. The food is delicious and plentiful. I had the mixed grille and found everything to be really tasty. Compliments to the chef and staff.
For a college town, this cuisine adds great diversity to the spread of choices. Thanks very much! Good choices and prices for a substantial meal.
First time I went it was really good, but the second time it wasn't and customer service was really bad and they overcharged us.....what's up with that?
Fresh food, clean place, good prices, highly recommend.  I always get the gyro and love that the meat isn't greasy!
Wife and I came here for lunch during a bike ride to Tempe. It's a small place, not much ambience and looks more like a fast food food joint.

I ordered the gyros platter, so mediocre!!!! Meat was decent but the hummus and rice had no flavor. Also on the plate was considered a "side salad" but it's just few pieces of romaine one tomato slice and one cucumber..again no flavor. The pita they give was definitely store bought low quality.

My wife had chicken kabob plate and the chicken was good but she too had the same sides I did and we didn't touch much of it.

Prices are fair but I can't recommend this place..it's not bad but not good either...it's just there.
This is a smallish owner-run place on Mill Ave. in Tempe. We were warmly greeted when we walked in--there were very few other customers, although I have no idea why because everything was delicious and freshly made. I had the chicken kebob plate, which came with a side salad and various dipping sauces. All tasty and well made. We will definitely be back.
Had the chicken kabob. Meat is delicious. Hummus and salad are delicious but the portions are extremely small. You might get two forkfuls out of the hummus. 

Tons of rice though. Since it's cheap, presumably.

I'll try it again in a few weeks.
Everything I consumed was pure deliciousness.  I will probably have occasional day naps where I dream about my meal. We got the small beef kabob,  gyro combo, and hummus platter. I tried all of it and every item was great (even the rice).  The beef kabob also had a little spice too itn the perfect kick.  I will definitely be back. Yum yum in my tum tum!
Best turkish food in Arizona that I have tries yet. I get the chicken plate and love it with the yellow rice. The owner is incredibly welcoming and love that they are always playing soccer matches on tv. They also have excellent baklava for dessert. Authentic turkish food. Highly recommend if you are looking to leave a place with a full belly and satisfied.
Just picked up an order from here, the beef kebab and the beef gyro plate. $26.00 for skimpy portions, and no pita bread. Needless to say I live too far away to go back. Very disappointed. Food is nothing above average either.
Pros:
Adana kebob is tasty. 
Other kebobs and gyros are supposedly good but haven't tried yet. 

Cons:
Too pricy for such little portions!
Rice is bland. 
Hummus is good but you only get @ 2 spoonfuls. 
Mint salad is just cucumbers, tomatoes, barely any mint or other flavors. 
Fast food feel to the restaurant based on ambience (or lack thereof) and cheap plastic plates. 

In short, it's the kind of place that is probably best at 2 a.m. after college kids are kicked outta the bars and need something substantial to soak up the alcohol they've consumed. So their quality may work for their location on Mill. Other than that, not worth a repeat visit.
I love Nargile. The staff there are wonderful and really make you feel welcome. It's a fairly small restaurant with an intimate atmosphere.


 The quality of the food is stunning, with a really good choice. You feel like you want to have everything, so it's quite difficult deciding! There is a good choice of Turkish wine available, too.


 The owner obviously takes great pride in making sure everything is just right, which it is. Highly recommended.
Fantastic turkish food right in the "modern" heart of Edinburgh!  I had the "Biberli Kusu Izgara" main dish (lamb) which was excellent and finished it off with a "marshmallow"  dessert.  Service was fantastic...
If you are in the mood for traditional Turkish food, look no further than Nargile. Situated in Hanover Street, Nargile is in the heart of the New Town area of Edinburgh and it is just around the corner from the main shopping street, Princes Street, and so it is a convenient place to reach. 

I came here for the first time several months ago for my lunch, and I wasn't all that sure what Turkish food was when I entered the restaurant, but I had an amazing experience here, and will definitely be back. Nargile' menu offers a vast selection of choice of traditional and authentic Turkish food including kebabs, rice, fish and meat dishes. I ordered the mezze dish, which was about six or seven small portions of different dishes and they were a mixture of hot and cold meals. It was really delicious and it included kebabs and prawns marinated in a really fresh sauce that was full of flavour - really yummy! The food here is excellent value for money, with a three course meal and glasses of wine costing ¬£20 - such a bargain for this area of Edinburgh. 

The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming and were very patient with me in explaining what the dishes were! Nargile is a fabulous Turkish restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.
Oh boy. Well, the boy actually in this case, because he came up trumps in picking out a place for my birthday meal. Middle eastern food? Somewhere I have never been as I haven't yelped it yet? Oh yes, he knows me well. 

So Nargile - lovely restaurant, if on the chilly side (we were seated in the window so that might have been the problem). Big buckets masquerading as wine glasses. 

Being a Tuesday night, it wasn't particuarly busy read: dead when we arrived, but business was picking up by the time we left, so we had the place to ourselves. Food took a while to arrive, but what can you say when it is freshly cooked? 

If you want a recommendation, then I strongly would suggest that you try the shaksuka - although the menu indicates it is lightly sauteed aubergine but really, it is chargrilled to an inch of it's life, releasing all that delicious smoky aubergine flavours that we know and love. Contrasted with a light dip and deliciously dressed onions, oh, I could have eaten it all day. Other starters sampled included the stuffed mushrooms, sauteed king prawns (with luscious plump roasted tomatoes) and the dana sogush. Not a single complaint arose from the table. I think some amongst our party might have tried to lick their plates clean. 

Mains: I had the monkfish and prawns on tomato and olive sauce. Now, here I think Nargile fell down, as the tomato sauce was strongly at odds with the flavours of the monkfish and prawn (both beautifully cooked) - both good, but an unsuccessful match, I felt. I also snuck in some creamed spinach on the side, mainly because I love the stuff, and it didn't disappoint here. 

The boy and the mother both ordered the Kuzu Kus Kus - a giant plate of cous cous and root vegetables delivered with a separate bowl of collapsing lamb on the bone and more vegetables. A success from both sides. The father tucked into a mammoth mixed kebab which he struggled to finish, such was the quantity of meat in front of him. But you have to try, don't you?

Finally, although we were all groaning and trousers were a-popping, of course we had dessert. Baklava, the mallow surprise (?) and sorbet were delivered. For me and the father,  the baklava was nice but way too heavy on the almond flavours, that the 3 pieces were too much - one would have sufficed. The marshmallow dessert was a hit with the boy as was the sorbet with the mother. All washed down with fresh mint tea and a bottle of New Zealand wine (The Jive Pinot Noir, nom nom nom). 

Nargile - I think you are great. Perhaps lose some of your western influences (like the overly strong tomato and olive sauce) - you don't need it - the rest of your food stands strong.
I've been to Nargile twice.  The first time was around Christmas and my boyfriend and I enjoyed a lovely set meal for two, where you get a choice of starter, main and dessert for about ¬£14 per person.  We had the hummus and sucuk, which is Turkish sausage for our starters and both were delicious.  I had the mixed kebab, which comes with rice, salad and chili sauce for my main while my partner had a lamb kebab, which came with chips and salad.  Both were delicious. Our dessert was an assortment of baklava and ice cream.  Overall, with a few drinks our bill came to roughly ¬£40.00, which we felt was great value for money! The only catch was the deal was only available up until 7pm, which wasn't a problem for us.  They also had Christmas crackers at our table which was a nice touch! We left feeling we would definitely come back.

Fast forward from Christmas to April 15th.  We had purchased a Groupon voucher several weeks back entitling us to a two-course meal, including a glass of house wine or Efes beer.  For my starter, I had the fried halloumi cheese.  It was absolutely spot-on! You got 3 large bits of cheese with a drizzle of olive oil and some sun-dried tomatoes.  Delicious! The regular price for this dish is ¬£5.50 and I felt it was decent value for money.  My boyfriend went with the Dana Sogush, which is described as "strips of char grilled beef, tossed with fresh coriander, red onion, chili and mixed salad in an olive oil and lemon dressing".  Now picture what you think that would look like in your head.  I pictured lovely strips of beef, maybe not thick, but at least sizable, tossed in this lovely sounding dressing with a bit of salad on the side, as this starter is ¬£6.95.  The dish comes out and it's basically a salad of cucumber, red onion, tomato and lettuce, with a few miniscule "strips" or mini pieces of beef. While it had a lovely lovely flavour, there was hardly any beef in what was supposed to be a strips of beef starter.  Maybe we were just unlucky and had a one-off end of the batch salad, but this was definitely not good value for money. Good thing we had the Groupon voucher!!

For our mains, I decided that since we had a Groupon I would take advantage of it and get the steak and prawn kebab, which comes with rice, salad and chili sauce, for ¬£17.50.  My boyfriend got the escallops of Monkfish with a tomato-herb sauce and cheese, over a bed of cous cous with salad on the side.  His main was ¬£16.95.  While the flavours of my steak and prawn kebab were fantastic, again it was not good value for money (thank-you Groupon, once again).  I had two bits of beef and two prawns, about a half-cup of rice and a salad consisting of tomatoes, cucumbers and red onion mixed with some lettuce.  There is no way on earth that this dish costs more than ¬£7-10 to produce.  Now if you got two kebabs, maybe it would be worth the ¬£17.50 menu price, but I highly doubt it.  The Monkfish had a slightly larger portion and nice flavours.

For dessert, I had the assortment of baklava with pistachio ice cream. It was devine and I would recommend that. Most desserts are in the ¬£5 range but you can get scoops of ice cream starting from ¬£1.95.
Overall, while I do like Nargile, I don't feel the food is good value for money. I would only consider going back if I had another Groupon or if there was a set-menu deal like the one at Christmas. I don't know why anyone pays full-price for some of these dishes!!!
Nargile offers Edinburgh diners an excellent insight in to Mediterranean-style Turkish cuisine. We sampled an excellent array of hot and cold meze, served in a simple, elegant style. We really enjoyed our visit. 

Overall, we said: "the whole experience was one that we would happily repeat. We really want to return there when we can have a go at their full menu."
I have been here a few times, first and foremost the service is always impeccable. Friendly, welcoming and they like to chat and have a joke.

Food is right up my street, combination of flavours from across the med done in a sharing style. Starters we all opted for the mezze, no less than 14 dishes appeared before us with breads as well - so tasty lots of flavours going on and very fresh tasting NOM NOM NOM.

For mains I went for a sea-bass dish that was spiced and served with a bean and sun dried tomato salad. Very very tasty!!!!! Fish was perfectly cooked, the spice added flavour while keeping the great taste of the fish, and the serving was huge. Very very happy JD!!

Desert was a tough one - in the end I opted for a scoop of raspberry sorbet and one of pistachio ice cream!! Should they go together you may well ask??? Many would say no....but I say say.....YES!!! The sorbet is packed full of taste but is possibly too tart so the pistachio adds a earthy richness that offsets it nicely between mouthfuls!!

Add to that a nice little wine list and these Aberdonian boys are doing the tastes of the middle east a huge boost!! Recommend happily!!

As for the last star - for the setting, for the style, for what it could be, I think they need to refine things a little more to hit that high note!
If you like meze, then Nargile is the place to go.  Centrally located on Hanover street, and serving food all day, it is the ideal place for a late Saturday lunch with a friend.  
The food is lovely, as well as the staff, and you can also try some lovely Turkish wine for under ¬£20 a bottle.
Highly recommended.
A couple of  weeks back,  Lynsey F and I were planning to go to the Edinburgh Art School Degree show however, we didn't pay attention to our ticket time and the time slot we had was too early for both of us to attend. Instead, Lynsey F suggested using a voucher she had for Nargile, and heading out for an  'appreciating  the Degree show with a glass of wine and Meze...even though we didn't actually go' dinner.  

Oh my godness...Heaven actually is a place on Earth (Belinda Carlisle got that right!)

The interior of this family-run restaurant is subtle and elegant, with lots of space between tables and beautiful artwork adorning the walls. Service was prompt, efficient and the waiting staff really knew their menu.

Then the food started coming, little dishes of the most scrummy things! There were crunchy salads, humus, pitta bread, spicy lentils, halloumi, filo pastry rolls with feta and spinach, falafel, grilled aubergines and mushrooms in a creamy sauce. All of them absolutely, positively fresh and delicious! Being vegetarian, I got my own little plate of additional veggie delights, while Lynz had a similar plate of meaty treats!

We were given information about all the dishes, we enjoyed all the dishes and ate every last morsel of each dish (I would have happily licked each dish clean were we not in such a classy establishment!)

Our wine was an extremely nice Pinot Grigio (not too expensive at ¬£16.95 a bottle), and we finished our meal with some baklava and pistachio ice cream. The baklava was a wee touch dry, and could have used a bit more honey...but hell...that's a minor detail after such a lovely meal.

I can't remember the exact cost as we had a voucher, but the prices are extremely reasonable for such lovely, quality food. I left thinking we'd have to find something else soon we can get tickets for and not go so we can come back but, on second thoughts, I don't really think I need an excuse!
Es war alles sehr sauber und ordentlich.
Die Portionen waren sehr gut und vor allem sehr lecker.
Die Bedienung war freundlich und schnell.
F√ºr mich immer wieder gern.
Taken to Hanedans by a friend of mine who had lived in Turkey for a number of years, i was promised that Hanedans had the 'best Turkish food not in Turkey'. Quite a claim indeed.

Hanedans however, didntlet me down - certainly the vast amount of food that was ordered (which was great for us all to share about) was very tasty indeed, if not quite my thing. It is however quite clear of the chef's passion for his food as it is all beautifully presented as well as great tasting.

Staff were friendly and the restaurant was relaxeing, if a bit cramped with so many tabvles in a small room.

Overall, while not quite Turkey the country, Hanedans is no turkey itself.
In my view, Hanedan is flawless.  It serves delicious food in huge quantites, has a really homely atmosphere with relaxed staff and it's all well priced on top of this.  This is probably one of my favourite restaurants in Edinburgh and I've been a few times, always leaving stuffed and happy.  The menu has an excellent selection of slow-cooked meat and vegetarian dishes as well as a wide range of kebabs, dips and breads.  I usually have either the marinated 
lamb or chargrilled chicken which is served on a skewar with fresh salad and a really light, fresh yoghurt dip.  
They also do a lot of quality wines and beers alongside iced teas and specialist coffees.  You can can have a great meal here for about a tenner which is great value when you consider the quality of the experience as a whole.
What a Turkish delight this was to stumble across. Quite hungry one evening, my family and I took a stroll through Newington. I love Newington for its modest-sounding restaurants dotted around the streets. Our visit here wasn't planned, it was simply a case of when our stomachs got the better of our feet. So we stopped walking, surveyed the menu and popped in.

And boy did we choose right. Playing Russian Roulette with me and food, especially when I've got an appetite going, doesn't always look pretty. But Turkish = meat = gooood. And Hanedan Turkish meat = very goooood.

Without any hesitation, I ordered the lamb cutlets, and we all shared an array of starters. Kebabs and eastern meaty dishes are often better known to a lot of us when accompanied with chips, cheese and a naan out of a polystyrine box. (So good at the time, yet so regretable). And quite a few turkish and eastern restaurants can often produce a more up-market version of the same donner down the road. 

Hanedan is different. Worth every single one of those 5 stars, the meat was deliciously cooked, and had everything I love about Turkish meat-cooking. The taste of charcoal, the spicy tomato sauce, the juicy still-pink centre. Mmm. 

Everything else was wonderful too. Great service, fast and friendly. Prices were reasonable, or what you'd expect for well cooked red meats. Caraf of house red was good. My one and only gripe is that the seats were quite crammed in close together, and I got shunted about a few times. But it does lend a 'homely' and cosy feel to the place. And really once I start eating, a hurricane could tear the place down and I wouldn't notice so I soon forgot about it.

Hanedan - you had me at hello.
The food here is subtle, unpretentious, and above all, very good. I recommend the roast aubergine dip from the starters and the moussaka, but you can't go wrong with the houmous and chicken kebab either.


 For some reason they always have on as background music a French internet radio station that plays a mix of classical and jazz, which is eclectic but pleasant.


 Definitely worth returning to regularly.
I've said it once and I'll say it again, what a turkish deligh Handean is.

I came back here about half a year after my first and only visit and was worried that it might tarnish my very happy memory. I was worryingly needlessly.

It's a great family-feel restaurant, it was bustling and warm, with kitchen as you walk in with flashes of fire as they cook up your meat and kebabs.

I had the aubergine to start, and lamb cutlets. It was absolutely delicious, the lamb was cooked wonderfully and had that great charcoal taste (in a good way, y'know?)

Also, I'd absently asked for my lamb medium-rare (I like it pink). I thought it was just standard, but the chef came up and said "I hope it's ok, I tried my best to get it just as you want it'. And he managed. I liked how earnestly he had wanted to make my lamb. 

This is tucked up a side-street in Newington, and not one many people would stumble across, but for a lunch or dinner with family, friends, or even a romantic meal for two - for mainly meat eaters although there are veggie options - this is a winner. It's really reasonably priced (¬£8.95 for the lamb cutlets) and the quality of food far exceeds the price.

I can tell I"m going to become a regular.
Probably my favourite restaurant in Edinburgh and definitely one of the most stylish uses of a small space in terms of lighting (atmospheric), use of space and design.
Utterly charming, often full on a damp Tuesday night in February, and everyone I have taken has loved it.
Food always great - I love the humous and chicken kebab deal so much that I always seem to end up reordering - great authentic use of dried oregano and mint too.
Edinburgh is quite good at these small unpretentious neighbourhood restaruants and I feel lucky to live in the next street.
I love Turkish food.  The problem with Hanedan is that I love the food so much that I just wanted to order everything on the menu and eat it all.  The other problem is that the portions are *really* generous so you end up feeling as though you might need to be rolled out of the restaurant because you can't bring yourself to stop eating because it's too tasty.  

In addition to the incredibly tasty and lage plates of food, the staff and owner/chef (I think?) are absolutely lovely and good for a laugh, and the setting is cute and cozy.  

I would say that the only downside is that the mains seem to be quite plain - meat and rice - and really would benefit from an accompaniment.  You end up almost needing to order a starter in order to have a bit of variety, but you ultimately end up with too much food, really.  I couldn't finish my main and had absolutely eaten as much as could fit in my belly.
Came here on a suggestion from the host of our B&B, who I think comes here at least twice a week (he actually went there the night he recommended it to us because, as he said it, talking about it made him crave it!)  I love being able to visit the places tucked away from touristy areas, and this was it!

We ordered the hummus and feta salad to start, and what amazing portions!  The waitress had to bring out a second basket of pita to finish it, with the added bonus that it was warm when it arrived, yum!  Feta tasted homemade it was so soft and flavorful, and there were so many plump veggies in the bowl that I couldn't finish it!

We both got the chicken shish, which had a lovely grilled flavor and perfectly made rice.  I think we piled on the spicy sauce to add a little perk to the meal, but that's why they serve it, I guess!  Overall it was delicious and we left feeling absolutely stuffed.

One small note, make sure to get a booking because we didn't (as we arrived at 5:45 when there was almost no one seated) and were told that we had to be out by 7 at the latest.  It was no problem to do so, but I felt a little rushed.
I can't add much to the host of 5 star reviews here really, can I? Consulted Qype for a reasonably priced but decent quality restaurant for a meal out one evening, & figured I should see what all the fuss was about. All the charms are exactly as described, & our food was excellent. Took the recommendation on the Borek (spinach filo parcels) as a starter & wasn't disappointed. Lamb kebab for main was a real meat feast  just simple, perfectly cooked, well presented hunks of meat with rice & a relish. Will definitely go back.
the food was fresh and extremely good value for money. the service was fast and friendly, and the wine was lovely and chilled, just how i like it!

the girls bathroom had a choice of 8 different types of soap and the boys had four...now that is impressive! it kinda feels like you are eating in someone's living room, and it might be not be the best place for the biggest, most rowdy of groups, but for a quiet, chilled out evening meal, i would definitely recommend.
Simple and perfect. I had some if the best lamb skewers in my life. Perfectly seasoned and cooked with a little rice and chili sauce. The place is small, but cozy. The service was excellent and the owner was incredibly charming. If I lived in Edinburgh I would become a regular.
Hanedan serves really good food in relaxed surroundings. Their chicken skewers locked in an excellent amount of flavour and the soup was lovely. I look forward to my next visit.

Overall, we said: "I was delighted with Hanedan. I'll need to come back with a few chums to have a good go at their meze, but on the basis of today I have a strong feeling that this is the best place for Turkish food in the city. I'd heartily recommend you pay it a visit, at your earliest convenience."
Easily my favourite restaurant in Edinburgh. The food is fantastic.  It is a small restaurant and can be really busy so its best to reserve a table - especially on the weekends.  I just travelled through Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the USA and i couldn't find any Turkish food as good as that in Hanedan.  We always order a few starters between us: the hummus, feta salad and the meatballs are our favourite; this also comes with all you can eat pita bread.  The feta cheese is unbelievably creamy and all of the meat is so juicy - I recommend the chicken or the lamb.  But I can never choose between the meats, so I usually have the mixed grill.  Also, even the rice is tasty - I don't know how you can make rice tasty, but they do it.  I look forward to eating here every time I make a reservation.
My brother flung the door open with a flourish and strode in. "I'M TAKING YOU OUT FOR TURKISH," he announced. Bro, I am so there.

"There" was a little spot in Newington, huddling glumly in the blackness of a wet November night. No glumness was within, however: we were seated with jovial alacrity by the window, with some upbeat discussion of the view (sky water falling on road water, and some road water attempting in hissing salmon jumps to go back up to being sky water).

Seated in the dimness of almost total candlelight with the occasional orange flare of flame from the kitchen beside us, we were given a tour of the heating options (overhead and under the table). They brought us a little battery-powered lamp while we browsed the menu - such a thoughtful and cute touch.

We ordered three meze to start us off - herring salad, squid and walnut salad, and honeydew melon with feta cheese. Woah. The herring was deliciously sweet, fresh and syrupy; the squid had clearly at some point in its recent past actually been a squid, and the honeydew... hoooooooooo. I was expecting a couple of delicate slices but we were given a great bowl full of melony chunks and a goodly wadge of feta unexpectedly topped with mint, which was a lovely touch.  These three dishes alone were almost enough but we decided to get some mains as well since it was so good!

For Bro, grilled lamb. For Sis, vegetable moussaka. I'm told the lamb was awesome. As for my moussaka - well, I'm used to moussaka being something of a slop. A tasty slop, but slop nonetheless. This, however, had not only flavour but form and texture. It cut in neat slices and was quite the revelation - absolutely delicious. We rounded it all off with some gorgeous sticky baklava too, and the whole bill - illuminated by the return of the little battery-lamp - came to ¬£50. Amazing.

We sat there for a pretty long time waiting for the downpour to abate and never once felt rushed or like the staff were waiting for us to go. Once the sky water had finally all become road water, we left feeling about three stone heavier, but a fresh and healthy weight rather than just a lump of stodge. This was a meal I'll remember for a long time. Nonetheless, I might feel compelled before long to, er... refresh my memory...
I went here with a friend for a catch up.  After absorbing the relaxed and bohemian atmosphere (and a good lenghty chat) we finally ordered.  We decided to order a few starters and share, as it all looked so good!  The halloumi cheese was yum, the spinach/feta pastry was ace and the humus was beautiful!  Mains was a mixed grill for each of us and I don't think I've ever eaten such soft and scrumpalicious rice! (And I've lived in Japan!)  It was a perfect complement to the meat, which was also lovely.  The staff were attentive and our meal was reasonably priced for the quality of food.  All in all, a cosy and intimate restaurant with tasty food.  Will most definitely go back when in Edinburgh.
Cosy atmosphere and always a warm welcome

Turkish menu all lovingly prepared by Gursel, you can check it out online.

Delicious hummus to start off if you don't  fancy a proper starter, firin kofte (meatballs),  moussaka and chicken shish all highly recommended.
Small but beautiful , the food was just fantastic staff were lovely I would recommend this restaurant to my friends thank you guys
My partner and I went to Hanedans for date night dinner and absolutely loved it! We had a selection of starters then the moussaka and chicken skewers. De-lish!! The owner made sure we were well looked after and chatted with us for a while about his food and recipes. Service was good, not too intrusive and the ambiance was lovely. We've just moved out of the Newington area but will be back with friends for another Turkish feast soon.
I'd walked past the other branch of this turkish cafe, which is at the Royal Mile, and was surprised to see it again on a day trip to Leith!

In Edinburgh, one's got the option to eat foods from so many different cuisines of the world, but I was still very excited to try the food here, as it's the only turkish restaurant I've come across so far. If you're not that much of an adventurous eater, there's the traditional fry-up breakfast as well as sandwiches, but the really exciting stuff is the array of mediterranean food they serve!

It's possible to have stuffed vine leaves, moussaka, and mezze platters, and there're some delicious desserts such as baklava available. 

The cafe's location at the shore means that you'll get some nice sea breeze and a great view to go with your food. It's good to keep in mind that they are a little bit pricier than a couple of other cafe's though!
If someone pushed me to choose my favourite cuisine, I might well pick Mediterranean, or, more specifically, Turkish food.  When I visited Istanbul as a child, I fell in love with the subtle flavourings, the hot and cold salads, the meltingly stewed vegetables and the honey-drenched sweets.

So, discovering Caf√© Truva on the Shore was a real treat for me.  It's a fairly casual little establishment, where you can drop in for lunch or coffee, or else pick out some items to take away.  They offer competent versions of favourite dishes, such as stuffed vine leaves, green bean salad, and, of course, gloriously sticky baklava, which are all tasty, if not as absolutely stunning as this kind of food has the potential to be.  

I haven't had a chance to try any of their sandwiches, but I was pleased to see that they have a good selection of vegetarian options - too many Turkish places offer kebab, kebab, or kebab.  Overall, this brightly-painted caf√© is an inviting place to stop by for a light meal, and, while the Waters of Leith don't quite measure up to the Bosphorus, with a little imagination you might be able to conjure up an image of Turkey here.
Turkish cuisine isn't necesarily as chic, or in vogue, or as easy to find as it's Mediteranean neighbours on the high street. So I was quite bemused when I first stumbled across Cafe Truva. Chic it is not, but authentic it most certainly is. 

After 3 hours of ambling along the Water of Leith walkway, my friend and I were in need of lunch. Cafe Truva stood like a beacon on its corner, and I admit it did look a bit oddly placed. With no other cafes or bars around, it seemed to not quite 'fit in'. But after eating, drinking and relaxing there, I can understand why.

It has a homely, open and airy feel. The tables and chairs are a bit rickety, in fact the whole place feels like it hasn't been revamped in at least 20 years. This isn't a bad thing. It has charm. And some aspects of the decoration were quite stunning. I immediately liked it. It was Turkish in essence, and so wasn't trying to be Turkish. 

The menu was reassuringly bizarre. English translations were limited, and I didn't know what half of the things were. The cakes on display were unlike most I've seen in regular Edinburgh cafes. Turkish delight, of course, but many other cakes that I must go back and try.

I had the lamb meatballs, and my friend the feta and spinach pastry parcels. (There were real Turkish names for these dishes and I'm afraid I can't remember them. I feel so fake.) Tasty, meaty, cheesy, tomatoey goodness. Not blow-your-socks tasty (like the other Turkish restaurant I've reviewed) but I think because the cuisine was cafe style rather than restaurant. The side salad was presented in a dated and generic manner, with a few bits of iceberg lettuce, some cubes of feta, and a few olives. I think in comparison to the many other nouveau-med cafes around that are bang on trend, it seemed a little...lacking. 

But then my friend ordered a coffee and I was very impressed by how it came. It was real, gen-yoo-an Turkish coffee. It came with a small cup, a medium sized metal pot, that you steeped for a while then served. It was sweeter than normal coffee, but also darker and richer. Like nothing I've ever tried. And it complimented the cake we shared wonderfully (an intensely sweet, gooey layered honey and nuts creation. Again, authentic, and again I can't remember its name...)

Cafe Truva is a slightly odd creature, but it has charm. It is authentically authenitc, rather than hamming it up for the tourists authentic. It feels like its been lifted straight from a Turkish village, circa 1980, that the locals visited for their afternoon coffee and cake. It's not trying to impress the ladies-who-lunch crowd, or compete with other nouveau-med joints. 

I wouldn't say to take a trip out here just for this cafe. But I would say if you're in the area, go and if you go, order the coffee and a sticky, sweet cake. And the meatballs (although not necesarily in that order.)
Although it has a sister coffee shop on the Royal Mile, I didnt get the same experience in this one.  The staff were a little rude, although it did supply some lovely goodies.
Cafe truva is a fit and healthy 3 if ever i saw one. Big portions, delicious pita (OK so not really supposed to eat pita bread at the moment but the temptation was too much) and generous nice salads. The chicken panini was bit tough for the boy's liking. Stuffed vine leaves were nice, the green olives that came with the salad were drop dead delicious with this buttery overtone that I didn't expect. Artichoke salad wasn't drained properly (artichokes from a can) so there was a lot of water combined with dressing that sadly soggi-fied my pita. Definitely nice, and a generous menu fit for most dietary needs. Baklava and assorted sweets looked appetizing. It's not a must visit, but it's definitely a good place to go if you need a lunch spot in Leith.
Great food, great service especially good with children/families. I don't know why the others didn't rate it higher!
Cafe Truva on the Shore. This is one of the places that only get better and better! It has been there for years (in effect since 1998!) It went from small Turkish offerings to the full well placed Eastern Med  restaurant chain (3 restaurant and counting) 

I like this original shop. Cosy, clean and very friendly. They are frequented by locals as well as day trippers to the shore. It is well placed on the edge of the Shore over looking the water and it is a sun trap! Winter or Summer - if the sun is out - Truva will be in it. - The food is definatly Turkish with added burgers and panini's - the whole day breakfast (Turkish or Scottish) is a treat and a feast. Not too expensive. 

They offer free WiFi, take-away and also do outside Catering
I have been a customer of Cafe Truva on the Shore for a few years now. It is a firm weekend breakfast favourite, especially on those weary mornings following a late night... 

Cafe Truva has a menu of various breakfast choices, salads, paninis, sandwiches, kebabs, falafel etc. There is something for everyone, I think. 
I am most familiar with the ham & cheese croissant which comes with a side salad, little bit of cous cous and hot peppers. I have also tried the delicious turkish breakfast: cheeses, meats, cucumber, tomato, egg and toast. After you have had this and a cup of coffee, you feel you can conquer almost anything :)

Last week I sampled the lentil soup and it came with a toasted large roll. Takeaway price for this lunchtime favourite was only ¬£ 1.60 which is very reasonable. 

The cafe is fairly small but cosy. There are a few outside spaces as well and on sunny days they get quickly snapped up by locals.

I recommend this place - a little bit of Turkey on the Shore :)
Years ago, I was in Egypt and a man told me, "someone gave you bad eyes."

I figure he's talking about my glasses. I 

 nodded and explained, "yes, I got them from my Dad."

"No....BAD eyes."

"My glasses?"

"No. Someone made you sick."

I was tummy sick. Ohwait!

"Yes, some guy at the pyramids put the evil eye on me."

My host nodded in satisfaction. 

If only, I'd eaten at Ibo's first, that would never have happened. During dinner, Mr Ibo gave me a little evil eye protection bracelet. 

If I'd never found the front door, I'd been out of luck too. (We drove around a bit to figure it out and still figured it wrongly.)

My guest and I ordered the mezze platter, which had some delicious baba ganoush, some decent stuffed grape leaves, a wonderful eggplant salad, and some other tasty bits. 

We had a mixed grill of deliciously seasoned chicken, lamb, and beef, with a lovely orange pilaf.

None of the food totally blew me away. All of it was very good. But the prices are spendy and the lunch prices are ridiculously spendy (meaning, not any different than dinner.) 

The average entree is $20, the average appetizer is $9. The interior of the restaurant is bigger and probably fancier than what should be called for. 

If this place were more reasonably priced, I'd have loved it. But at that price point, there are other options out there (you're not far off from places like Rosemary's) that offer a better value.

I want to see our city have more independent restaurants with offerings other than sushi, bar food, Italian, or Thai. I want to see innovative or ethnic restaurants thrives. But I'm not sure if Ibo's has the right mix to make it happen, even though I hope he does.
OK this could be a hit or a miss place for most people.  It all depends on what you order.

1 . Now, turkish food isn't something you can experience everyday in Las Vegas.  So try it and see for yourself.

2. The foods that were good: Manti, fried golden crispy pastry rolls filled with aged gruyere cheese, kofte and chicken adana.

3. The things that were bad: The waitress and the soup.

So I give this place 4/5 because the waitress can always be changed and the soup can always be skipped.  Its something unique to try.. 

Cheers!
Being that my husband is from Turkey and I have had lots of homemade Turkish food over the years Ibo's had a great appeal to me. The restaurant is divided into two parts - a bar on one side and a restaurant on the other. The divider is the restroom area. It really is like East meets West in there. The bar side during lunch has low lighting, rock and roll music playing, and the seats are around a dance floor area. On the restaurant side the seating is formal with a baby grand in the corner and Turkish music playing. There was outdoor patio seating as well. The whole design of the place is a little strange to me. 

The bartender/waiter seated me in the bar area. He was very nice. I did not even realize there were two sides to this place initially. There were a few lunch options that were both priced just under $10. You could add dessert and a glass of wine for another $2+. I went with the shepherd salad, hummus, and chicken kabob. I had the choice between two salads, three appetizers and two main dishes. I would have liked to see a few more lunch options on the main dishes. The regular menu was expensive however I know the amount of time it takes to prepare Turkish dishes so that is to be expected. 

The Sheppard salad was yummy. It had a nice blend of fresh tomato, cucumber and bell peppers. The lemon juice, olive oil and fresh parsley and just the right amount of salt was perfect. I was served a small basket of bread though was disappointed to see that it was a foccacia bread rather than a traditional pita. A plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar were on the side. The olive oil was pretty bland. 

The hummus was spicy, rich tasting, and very yummy. Hummus can be a tough thing to get just right so I give them an A+ on this appetizer. 

The main course was a type of chicken kebab made from ground chicken and pepper paste (a middle Eastern ingredient). My husband typically prepares this dish with ground beef and I prefer it that way. I didn't care for the chicken much. On the plus side, this dish also came with two small beef patties. They were grilled and tasted very good. A large portion of vegetables was on the plate. The veggies appeared to be fresh and were appealing to the eye however not to the palette. For some reason they tasted fishy. I couldn't figure that one out. There was a small serving of rice pilaf. The rice pilaf was very oily. 

The portions are incredibly generous. I noted that everyone there asked for to-go boxes. The service was pretty good. I may go to this place one more time to try some different items. 

There is a small cupcake place in the same strip mall area that is wonderful! Stop by there for dessert!
I went to Ibo for lunch with a couple of coworkers. We ordered the lunch specials. Their $9.95 lunch special lets you choose a salad and appetizer and entree. The $14.95 is the same plus a glass of wine or a dessert. 

We all ordered different things to try them all. The Mediterranean Salad was delicious and a very nice portion. The hummus was tasty with a nice balance of garlic and spices. The haydari was not a fave of mine. IT was really thick and a little bitter. The spinach Borek was very tasty yet lacked the crispiness of the phyllo. It seemed as if it were heated in a microwave. I had the grilled Salmon for my entree and it was cooked to perfection! The outside was perfectly crisped with grill marks and the inside was moist and delicious. I was disappointed that it didn't come with the sauteed spinach as it stated on the menu, but instead came with steamed veggies. The sauteed leeks under the piece of salmon were divine. The only complaint there would be the portion. The small piece of salmon completely hid the leeks, but once I found them I was in heaven! The rice was standard rice, nothing to rave about. The poached apricots filled with cremefraiche were delightful. The baklava would have been better if (again) the phyllo was crispier. 

The decor of the place is very rich and extravagant. The problem was that for lunch we were seated in the bar area which wreaked of cigar/cigarette smoke. I was able to get past that, but one of my coworkers was very bothered by it. 

The service was so-so. The guy that seated us looked like a patron in his t-shirt and Bermuda shorts. Our waitress was equally dressed down wearing daisy dukes and a random t-shirt. There were 3 other tables she was tending to so I sort of understood why the service was a bit slow. The one thing that really struck me as odd was when the host/maitre de brought us a refill of bread. We had almost finished our other basket of bread, but of course went for the fresh stuff when he put it on our table. The waitress then came to our table and said that it was supposed to be for the other table, and picked it up and gave it to them! We had our hands all over that bread! Why wouldn't she just go get another basket? There were literally 2 pieces left in the basket (covered by a cloth of course.)
Not bad. My friends and I had several appetizers. The bread was served fresh and piping hot. The calamari was nicely fried and tender. The hummus was very flavorful, a nice addition to the bread. As much as I wanted to, we were not able to try any of the entrees. Maybe, next time.
First, and it's a big first:  The menu has been changed.  It  is NO LONGER TURKISH AND MEDITERRANEAN.  And we didn't know until we were seated and looked at the menu.

We were greeted very warmly by the owner, whose name happens to be Ibo.  The main dining room is just beautiful:  perfect lighting, candles on tables that are covered with white tablecloths over skirts, large banquettes around the perimeter, attractive and heavy menus.  But alas, there was virtually no Turkish food, except for the usual hummus and babaganoush for appetizers, kofta for beef, and a chicken dish that was called Istanbul Chicken, but had nothing remotely related to Istanbul.

When I asked our waiter about this, he explained that the owner had made a business decision to change because Turkish wasn't bringing the customers, who were unused to such cuisine, and decided to make it a steakhouse.  But the lighted sign above the restaurant is the original one, so IMO, it's a losing proposition for the owner:  those thinking this is Turkish won't come because it's "strange", and those of us who know and love Turkish food won't return because it's not!

I asked for a wine list, and was dismayed to see that it crossed the $7 barrier - there was not a glass of wine less than $8 or $8.50, and most were more.  We were two couples, and the other couple decided to forgo the wine.  My husband and I told the waiter that we weren't going to pay $8.50 for a glass of Riesling, and started to hand him back the menu.  He then offered to charge us $7 a glass.  I didn't know you could bargain for wine!

We munched on excellent bread while waiting for our entrees.  Choosing the entrees wasn't easy, since we hadn't been expecting to be choosing from steak and Italian dishes, but we settled on two Istanbul chicken, kofte with kasseri cheese, and rainbow trout.  Entrees were served with lentil soup or salad, and garlic mashed and fresh vegetables.  We all had the salad, comprised of mixed greens, some shredded carrot and chopped tomatoes, with a choice of three ordinary dressings.  The salad was very fresh and a good-sized portion.

When the waiter brought the entrees, he told my friend to be careful, because she might find bones in her "fileted" trout.  It was full of bones, and she had to send it back.  Both men ordered the chicken with the butter sauce on the side.  This dish consisted of thick slices of chicken that had been rolled around a spinach and carrot filling.  There wasn't enough of the filling, and because the chicken hadn't been heated in the sauce, it was quite dry.  My friend had substituted the same chicken for her bony trout; she forgot to specify the butter on the side and the waiter didn't think to ask, so hers came covered with the sauce.  It may have been chock-full of calories, but was much moister.

My Kofte was a large portion of five patties (each slightly larger than you'd find on a slider) of the ground beef.  It was tasty, but bland, and lacking the necessary black pepper that distinguishes it from an ordinary burger.  But I had forgotten that kasseri cheese is the equivalent of parmesan, so it also added a lot of salt, too much for my taste, though many others wouldn't think so.

The big disappointment with the dishes were the sides:  the mashed and the veggies were cold.  We told this to the owner, who had stopped to check our table.  He apologized profusely and returned a few moments later with a plate filled with four scoops of hot mashed potatoes and lots of the same nice vegetables, but well-heated.

Only when I went to the lounge, which is completely separate from the main dining room, did I see a scrolling sign over the bar indicating that this is "Ibo's Steak House." What a shame!  Las Vegas, which has quite a few Mediterranean restaurants, really could have used a good Turkish one.  Ibo's, if ever it was one, is no longer.  

In summation, the ambience is very beautiful.  The outdoor patio is quite large and would be oh so inviting if the weather were warmer.  The lounge and bar is attractive, also filled with tables and banquettes, and is equipped to provide live music, which there wasn't on our Saturday night visit.  I don't know if they ever have it.  The owner is friendly and very eager to please.  But without the ethnic differentiation, this is just a lovely setting with good to mediocre food, and nothing else to distinguish it from hundreds of others in Vegas.  Except for what has to be a huge rent, due to the sheer size of the place, that will probably render this review obsolete within a few months.
Loved the atmosphere! BEAUTIFUL walk-way to the restaurant with sparkling pavement and lights. Interior is also very tasteful with great decor! The lights were just right, not too dim and not too bright. LOVED  the flame-less candles adorning all of the tables! 

Now, for the not so good...I came to the restaurant expecting authentic Turkish fair, and got some American steak-house instead! I wish there was some kind of announcement online, so when I looked at the menu I wouldn't have expected Turkish food...I guess it's part my fault and I should have read Yelp before I went :D 

At first we got bread and olive oil/vinegar blend. The bread was good, but not the best. The oil dip was a bit thick on vinegar. Hummus was average; My friend commented that it tasted just like store-bought. I thought it was a little better than that, but still not great. Calamari was excellent. Mediterranean salad was very heavy on cheese, which I didn't like. The vegetables tasted fresh, but all that cheese distracted from the flavors. The Turkish pudding dessert (one of the few remaining Turkish dishes) was tasty, but nothing ground-breaking. And $7.95 for a small piece seemed a little steep. Overall prices were reasonable, however, for this caliber of a restaurant.

Service was nice, not overbearing and helpful.

On the way out, we noticed that one of the steaks of other patrons looked very pink and undercooked. It did not look appetizing at all. Of course, she could have ordered it that way...

Overall, loved the atmosphere and the service. Food was mediocre. I am sure I would have loved the Turkish fair here, but certainly was not impressed with "steakhouse" food. I felt a little deceived in the process as well. I probably won't be back here.
Not a Turkish restaurant. And when it was, created bad reputation for Turkish food. I'm not sure how it is as a steak retaurant now, make sure it's not the same owner anymore...
Terrible food.  There was no background music playing in the restaurant once you sat down so you could hear people's conversations from across the room.

Midway through the meal, a random woman from the street came up and asked us for money!!

No return for us, ever!
nternet sitesinde calma saatleri 4 pm - 4 am yaziyor.30 miles yol yapip gittikten sonra kapal olmas tam bir hayal krkl acilen saatlerini web sitenizden duzeltmelisiniz...! Dont open this restaurant night time..
Dersim do Kebab's a little differently but because I don't know how they cook them I can't exactly explain why.

But I can be certain of the following.

1) I can go with ¬£10 and feed two people.
2) My food look's like it was cooked that day.
3) Virtually no grease from the Donner meat.
4) Crispy chips, NOT SOGGY!
5) Chatty staff.
6) Open later than you care to be awake.

Set the standard on Dalry road!
I agree with Stuart on certain points - Dersim Kebab House is open late and it's cheap, so in that sense its got its perks. But I'm put off by how glaringly greasy the food is.

I've not seen it open early in the day (to be fair, the thought of getting a kebab before midday is revolting), but illuminated by its strip lighting it looks a bit seedy at night.

Before you get in the door, you are greeted with massive laminated pictures of all the meal deals they do. They don't really try to tart up the appetisers by giving them names, they refer to them in numbers. Not exactly tempting when it's seemingly served up like prison food.

I'm being a bit harsh - the content wasn't actually that bad. Morbid curiosity led me to eat in here and I wasn't actually disappointed. Portions are very generous and the staff are friendly enough.

Don't get me wrong - I've had worse kebabs. But even though I'm basing this critique on the appearance of Dersim Kebab House, it's just as important as what's inside. With the shabby frontage and less than appealing signs in the window, they sell themselves short. The food is decent enough and if it's two in the morning, you could do worse than to hook yourself up with a kebab in here.
I came to Dersim Kebab House just over a week ago with a friend whilst we were on our way to a flat party.  It was the night of the football world cup finala and we were in a rush to get something to eat before getting there.  Thankfully, Dersim served us pretty tasty meals without any hassle at all.  
Their menu isn't exactly awe inspiring, but has all that you would expect from a standard kebab house.  I went for a chicken kebab with salad and chips which came to about ¬£3 along with a bottle of water - a pretty good deal.  The chicken, however, was a little dry but I managed to counteract this by squirting on a whole load of mayonnaise.  The salad was fresh and the chips weren't bad at all. My mate had a cheeseburger with chips which he thought was pretty average as well.
On the whole it's decent enough, value for money food and friendly service.
Was walking home really late after a nice girls' night and decided that I should indulge my sinful midnight hunger pangs so my friends and I hopped into Dersim Kebab House. Oh, the aroma!!

We weren't the only ones there at that hour (around 3am), 5 other people were in line for supper

Despite having made the wrong order and having to get them to change it (they were already making it, opps... guilty!), they were very nice about it and told us not to worry.

Finally, they gave us our large chicken kebabs for only 6.50! It had generous toppings and the meat tasted so fresh. I wish I found out about this place earlier!!
I can only speak for their Lamb Shish wraps; it's the only thing I've had, but several times at that. among the best here.
Sometimes, curiosity gets the better of us, and we just have to break that final barrier by taking a proper, sit-down meal in a restaurant, entirely alone. Despite having a newspaper on hand, I still felt obliged to explain my singularity to the guy working here via a half-hearted "I'm just on my lunch break." I got a sympathetic nod in return.

It was worth breaking the social boundaries however, and was the best lunch I've had in a while. There's only a very limited menu of 3 mixed meza plates on at lunch, and I went for the only meat-laden option. Grilled garlic sausages, chicken, i basket of flatbreads and a fantastic yoghurt sauce were all good, but the rubbery, meaty cheese was the star of the show. Utterly fantastic, especially when dipped in the sauce.

Great service too. I'll be back soon, hopefully with E-Bot in tow.
I've had my eye on Empires for some time. A little narrow door, sometimes perennially feeling like the place is never open. But open it was on a dark and cold Sunday night and what a warm, welcoming space it is for a Scottish winter. It's a cafe serving Turkish mezze - your standards - hummus, baba ghanoush, falafel, moussaka (Veggie and not so much) as well as more interesting choices such as crushed hazelnuts in a tomato sauce (delicious, thank you for asking). Served with warm plates of pitta studded with caraway seeds, mezze it might be but we came out stuffed. We also did take advantage of the size of our table and ordered the entire menu to try the lot. Overall, I didn't find any particular bum notes - although I was disappointed with the baba ghanoush personally, but everyone had their own opinion on what was best. I loved the char grilled aubergine, the boy thought the air dried Turkish sausage was delicious. The parents tucked into crushed walnuts and meatballs with gusto. 

If I went through everything we ate, it literally would be everything. We washed it down with pomegranate juice and mint tea. Water is served to the table in beautiful metal jugs (the decor of this place is just fab). Your meal is accompanied by an eclectic collection of music including local artists who also perform there live from time to time. I absolutely fell in love with this place. The boy (also known as the silent reviewer) argued that the price we paid was a little steep... I would argue for five mezze per person (16 quid), it was more than enough for one person.. three mezze may be just right. But for a throw caution to the wind and try everything meal, it was fab. 

Oh and before I forget - it's BYOB with a corkage fee and cash only payments - be warned!
What a gorgeous treasure trove of yum Empires is.

I had been wanting to go here for a long time. I love Turkish and Greek food, and the mezze style of eating (it just means more flavours and dishes to enjoy). So I was delighted to finally get to have dinner at Empires.

The first thing that struck me is "wow this place is gorgeous!" This is how I would decorate my living room if I could. All dark wood carvings, an ornate balcony carving, different coloured lamps hanging at different lengths, the colour of deep jewels. Opulent, rich, lush, cosy.

Except that it wasn't very cosy. It's now November, and getting pretty baltic. It was cold outside, and rather than that rush of warm air that normally greets you when you step into a restaurant, it was cold. We moved upstairs to the balcony area to get a bit more warmth. I'm told, though, that on a busy night it gets far too hot. But still...

The menu is quite straight forward. There's a range of different mezze dishes, and you can get 3 for ¬£12.95 or 5 for ¬£15.95 In hindsight, 5 was maybe a bit many but 3 just wasn't quite enough.

The aubergine dish was so yum and fresh and flavourful. The meatballs, oh yes please. The haloumi was a very strong, rich, salty haloumi. But who doesn't love squeaky cheese.

I also liked the way in which the 5 mezze were presented. Rather than 5 small dishes, they were all laid out nicely around a salad in the middle of a large plate. You can still share if you want, but it was just a nice quirk.

It'd be a great place to come in a big group, order EVERYTHING, feast and enjoy. But it was also perfect, intimate and cosy for meal-for-two.

I'll definitely come back, and soon. The food was beautifully seasoned, and whilst it may not break any barriers, it's reliable, traditional and delicious Turkish food in a beautiful (is slightly chilly) restaurant.
I love this place! When grey Edinburgh gets wet and very grey this is a place that brings you  to land of thousand nights and the Ottoman' palace by Istanbul's seaside. The place is small but so cosy one wish to never leave and continue the journey along the streets lit by the moon light and sounds of a multicultural mecca. 

Ceiling is covered with colourful lamps from the gran basar, oriental carpets and pillows. On week ends musicians plays and the atmosphere is rising to the corners of the neighbour hood on St Mary's Street.

The food is delicious and healthy! Simply!

Great place for parties as well as 1 to 1 dinner.
This wee place is really great! Particularly for people like myself who get ridiculous food envy/can't decide what to have for breakfast in the morning, so the mezze 'element' (meh) of the menu is ideal - pick a bit of this, dip a bit of that, done, you feel like you've had a bit of everything.

It was BYOB last time I checked, so remember your bottles if you want to have a bit of the hard stuff with your mezze. Also, it is wee as highlighted at the start, so book ahead if there's a bunch of you. There's a cool, almost loft-like space at the top of the restaurant for chilled dining, and there are often bands playing too.
First things first. Before you take a seat you must realise that this place is cash only. The nearest cash machines are RBS on North Bridge or the Tesco on Holyrood Road. Both a good 5 min walk away.

So after a detour to get cash (am I the only one that is over reliant on the plastic in my wallet?) we returned to a cozy table in the corner. Except the staff kept opening the front door to get rid of the incense smoke & each time I was hit with an icy artic blast...

It's byob which is cool. Neither I nor the new Mrs G were drinking. She had the mint tea & I tried the pomegranate juice. Both were fine. Water was presented in a lovely silver jug. 

Food wise we each opted for a 3 dish meze. I had the chicken, the meatballs & the olives. Mrs G had the halloumi, stuffed peppers & something else I can't quite remember. What we had was nice & tasty. We weren't told that they were out of pitta so it was a bit of a surprise when our plates arrived with some brown bread. Not what I was expecting & no comment/acknowledgement from the waitress either.

Unfortunately the bread had seeds in it which Mrs G can't eat (allergies) so I asked if we could have an alternative. The waitress was polite but adamant they had no pitta & even when I asked if they had anything else. Eventually I spoke to another member of staff & eventually we were offered some rice. Fair enough. Too much palaver though. It should've been much easier to sort out.

That's why it only gets 3 stars.
If you're looking for a takeaway that offers good quality at decent prices, Samsun's isn't the worst place to go by a long way.  Whether its fish and chips, kebabs, pizza or a burger, this place will be able to cook you whatever you need.

These aren't going to cost you very much, but if you've only got a small amount of change on you then the chips at ¬£1.50 are very good.

It's a quick and easy place to pick up some dinner or an after night out snack, and I'd consider it to be one of the best in the area, perhaps just behind the Kingfisher for chips though.
Not a great place for food, but when needs must Samsons serves a purpose. This is normally walking home late at night from punk gigs, pubs etc after skipping dinner thinking we will grab something on the way through the evening. The pakoras and pizzas are very reasonable, but the chips are a bit hit and miss. I am quite taken by their potatoe fritters for some reason, and I dont particularly like chips at the best of times. If you need food it always seems to be open and is proabaly the best option in the area for street food at night.
Even though Samsun's always seems relatively busy after about 10 at night the food is never fresh and certainly the chip shop side leaves the nasty clinging feeling of grease in your mouth, not appealing in the least. The only thing I have found that is passible is the pakora, however even these are not the best. Concorde at near by Tollcross isn't open as late but the food is better...

Samsun's survives I suspect on (uninformed) passing trade and kicking out time from the many bars in the area and from the Cav (Cavendish/Lava Ignite as was) night club...
Before you judge me for all my late-night kebab eating sins, hear me out.

Ok,yes, I had a hankering for hot meat, in a sandwich, at 11.30pm on a Thursday night. After a search on the Yelp app showed up no open Subway outlets nearby, I realised I would have to resort to a kebab.

Kebab shops in Scotland are generally unhealthy. Greasy, often coupled with chips, probably only 5% meat. But I was desperate.

So when I stumbled upon Pasha I was very pleasantly surprised. Clean, bright, with a menu that included chicken kebabs, and a very clean, fresh looking salad bar. I ordered my chicken kebab and waited as Ali (this is the guys name, we had time to chat and become acquainted!) grilled me some fresh chicken. Not pre-heated nonsense.

As I was waiting, we got chatting. Turns out it's a new store, only 6 months old, and Ali and his brother run it having just moved over from Turkey themselves 6 months ago. So, this is gen-yoo-un Turkish kebabs folks. Yes, it's a takeaway outlet that will cater to a lot of late-nighters but it lacks all the grease, curry sauce, and salt&vinegar of your regular kebab shops.

The kebab itself was delicious. In a huge wholemeal pitta bread, with fresh salad, and charcoaly-tasting hot chicken, mmmm num num.

If you're in the Tollcross area and have a hankering for some late night snackage, I couldn't recommend this place enough. Even if you're on a 'healthy January kick' the chicken kebab is a winner. It's the morning after and I don't have the food-baby of shame - win!

They also do FREE home delivery which is pretty awesome. I've uploaded photos of the menu, as they don't have a website. For all your kebab needs, check it. And say hi to Ali for me!
I know I have friends all over, but I didn't realise that I had a friend in Pasha until I stepped through the door. The prompt greeting from the fellow behind the counter was welcoming, verging on friendly. 

Seemingly to ensure absolutely -no- confusion on the point of whether or not we were buddies, he referred to me no fewer than half a dozen times as 'my friend' during the ten minutes I spent in the shop. Not bad for never having exchanged names, right?

After a brief perusal of the menu board, I opted for a basic donner kebab. Reportedly, they also serve up everything from burgers and chips to pizza to curries. Quite versatile, considering the wee footprint of this takeaway. With my meaty bounty (which barely fit in the styrofoam container!) in tow, I returned to my hotel room to stuff my face before passing out, as one does after four drams of whisky in one night. 

Though I can't rave much about the meat (it ran a bit on the dry side), Pasha certainly isn't stingy with portions. Even though my last meal was nearly twelve hours prior, I was still only able to get down about half my kebab before raising my white flag in surrender. The combination of freshly toasted pita topped with shaved lamb (presumably) and topped off with salad, a lone wedge of tomato, and a heavy dousing of white sauce left me feeling satisfied and sleepy.

And as if you had to ask what I did with the other half of my kebab... it vanished once the sun came up and tasted even better than the night before. Waste not, want not!
5 stars for a kebab, late-night takeaway. From a bonafide Foodie. Oh my.

But Pasha is definitely 'as good as it gets' as far as kebab shops and takeaways go. I've been back twice in the past 3 weeks and feel none the worse for it. Not even an ounce of guilt.

The reason being their chicken pitta kebab is really as fresh, wholesome and healthy (yes you read me right, HEALTHY) as you can get. It's fresh raw chicken, grilled in front of you, with salad and a freshly toasted pitta. I think if you opt for the donner / burgers / chips etc. you're going to get the regular kebab hangover and I can't claim it's healthy. But the chicken kebabs really are outstanding.

I brought the boy here the first time and he was really, really impressed. "It's been than out of a deli" were his exact words. So after a whisky tasting and fancy two-course dinner that was so small we were both still hungry, we actually purposely went out our way to come here for a fresh chicken kebab each. After a two-course meal. Yes I know. But no food baby the next day, and my jeans are none the tighter.

Every time I've been I've gotten chatting to one of the two brothers that run the place. As Kevin L says, it's also really friendly and I have also often been called "my friend". They're both Turkish, only opened recently, and it really is great, fresh healthy food available at 2pm.

It's clean, small and there's no clinging grease hanging around in the air. True testament that they're doing the best they can for Edinburgh late-night post-pub crawlers. Just make sure you're not too tipsy that you don't actually enjoy and appreciate it!
Read Jenny L's review before trip to Edinburgh; since Pasha is a short walk from where I'm bunking I ate a donner pita sandwich plate special with a big pile of meat, salad veggies & sauce, chips, and drink. Sandwich was sloppy, overflowing the pita and quite tasty. Turkish guys running it are really friendly, the food was quick, made-to-order, and reasonably priced so it's worth a visit.
This place varies depending on what you order it seems, eaten here a couple of times with mixed results. I ordered a hummous falafel pitta and some chips for my friend. Once we were up the road a bit I realise had no falafel or humous for roughly ¬£3.50 I got a value pitta bread and wilted salad. The chips were weird and followed the pitta into the bin. Previous to this I ordered chicken wings and my friend a pizza. The pizza was passable and the chicken wings quite nice. Two experinces one awful one middle of the road I guess. The staff are great though and very friendly which is what bumped this review up by one star. I would say avoid for anything other than kebabs which I am told are excellent. I dont eat kebabage so no idea on that front.
OK, no way that I can't give these guys five stars!

I've been a couple of times, and their late night guilt free chicken wrap is as good as any other if not better... at request they've added jalepenos to mine from the pizza toppings and anyone who knows me would know that's worth a star on it's own. I mean, it was GOOD as far as chicken wraps go in
general, not just 2am good. (It was 2am delicious!) ;-)

Where these guys earn five stars is a few weeks ago I called two minutes before closing really just to see if they actually closed at the stated time... sadly they confirmed they were to close in two minutes, so I thanked them and said goodbye... before I could hang up they asked if I wanted to put an order in so that they could hold it for me... I thought it
too much trouble given we were at least 10 minutes away, but they eventually persuaded me so an order was placed for a friend and I... 10 or so minutes later we showed up and almost didn't see the place... it was lights off, floor swept, closed, but yet they welcomed us and handed over
warm delicious wraps as if it were nothing. (I confess to having assumed they were busy and therefore over accommodating us, but that definitely wasn't the case.)

I've been a few times since and they are always friendly and accommodating, can't ask for more really. 

In the end this is a Mediterranean take away joint, but for the foreseeable future they've captured my business when a night calls for one!

PS. For what they are and the service they offer they earn five stars, but if this type of place isn't your thing then that's not likely to change... for the rest of us late night wanderers give them a try! :)
I got the beef doner plate.  It was ok, but not particularly flavourful.  Also, I didn't really feel filled up after I left.  But, like, ok, at the end of the day.
Love me some Rana. The chicken doner wrap is the best IMO
Quick and cheap middle eastern food, and surprisingly good for the price. The chicken donair is great, and the baklava is good enough. Grab the donair plate if you're looking for more value, though the pita is good for lunch.
I always get the same thing when I order at Rana: Chicken donar plate with extra rice and salad, no fries.

This dish is delicious, and big enough to eat for two lunches in a row. Tastes great warm and cold, and the service is always fast, even if there is a line.

My only complaint is that depending on who is on cash, sometimes they will let me get extra rice and salad in place of fries while other times, they will only let me get extra salad. Not sure what the big deal is there, since rice, salad, and fries are all pretty equivalent in terms of how much they cost to produce. However, that's a pretty small gripe...
Colleague: "What do you want for lunch?"

Me: "Meat."

Colleague:"...Rana?"

Me: "Yup."

That is how most conversations are carried out just before deciding on going to Rana for lunch.  Usually I order the chicken doner, no onions, and it will taste exactly as I expect it to taste: meaty, filling, and delicious.
We're regular visitors to Istanbul, so have been exposed to a fair amount of Turkish cuisine, be it home-cooked, in restaurants, or from takeaways. This place ticks a lot of boxes, giving diners a good representation of authentic Turkish dishes.

Overall, we said: "it was a lovely lunch, and a steal at the bargain price of ¬£6.50 for 2 courses and I recommend that you go if you are in the area and hankering for something different and good. I think I'd like to return one evening to see what the rest of the menu is like...or just to grab a lahmacan or 5 to take away."
When I first discovered the Turkish Kitchen a couple of years ago, it didn't look anything particularly special from the outside. 

I find this is very common with the places serving the most authentic food. 

Recently the frontage has been spruced up, but thankfully the food remains at the same high standard.

As the name suggests, it's a real family affair & you feel like a guest at their house eating home-cooked food, lovingly prepared and representing the best Turkish cuisine has to offer. 

It is also priced to suit most people's pockets & I really hope it stays that way. 

I can't wait to visit again!
My friend has been telling me of the amazing food delights available in this tucked away little restaurant for a long time now. On a recent Friday night I found myself a couple of pints in and in need of some good food with little fuss. Wandering along from the west end of rose street and really not in the mood for pub grub I remembered about the tall tales of amazing food and inexpensive prices, so I dragged the missus in for some meze. 

The decor is simple and straight forward and the restaurant clean and presentable. I am guessing the man that greeted us with a smile was the owner, as he seemed to take great pride in telling us about the food. He made us feel welcome and was happy to adjust the meze platter to be veggie. Good start all in. On taking in the surroundings a little more I realised the other tables all seemed to be turkish people enjoying food and mint tea. This is always a good sign for me.

Our food arrived and wow a giant plate of what was definately home made salads, hummous, pickles and meze. The Sarma and Zulma in particular were excellent. All this was served with home made pita breads. Big thumbs up all round.

When we went to pay I thought the meze platter was ¬£8 a head it turns out this was for us both, so including drinks we had a great meal for ¬£10!! Bearing in mind this was a friday night and easily for bad pub food you are looking at a tenner a head or more. The bench mark is now set for me in terms of turkish food and I will be back next time I find myself in this end of town.
The best hummus I've ever had. Best even better than what I've had in Israel! I also had the Lamb with tomato, onion and mushroom. It was all so tasty! Great portions at  great prices. The owner and chef is so sweet and helpful when ordering. Dine in or take out, it is nice for both.
Turkish Kitchen was a thoroughly decent, inexpensive meal for a group of us who hadn't booked a table in the city centre on a Friday night.

On sitting we were brought some bread and the most amazingly tasty dip ever.  I need to know what's in that dip because it was the highlight of the meal.  

Not very hungry, I opted for the Turkish ravioli which, despite not being listed on the menu, came with a side of salad and rice.  The sides were a bit awkward and somewhat wasteful, but were certainly tasty.  
The ravioli left a lot to be desired, primarily because it was so overcooked it came apart the minute it I tried to eat it.  The taste was fine though nothing compared with my other experience with Turkish ravioli, which was such a shame because I was expecting something really fantastic.  

I probably should have ordered something kebab-ey like everyone else, but I just wasn't in the mood for a meat feast.  Everyone else seemed happy with their meals, though.  

One weird thing was that when we ordered beer we got glasses which appeared all different sizes and smaller than what you would expect of either a pint or a large bottle. 

It was a really good option for a group looking for something cheap and cheerful but is, in my opinion, not Edinburgh's best Turkish by a long mile.
New, and still slightly struggling with its identity, Cafe Nemrut offers some nice, simply prepared Turkish dishes (which we sampled), sitting alongside more standard British all-day breakfast fare. I'm not sure this is a completely sustainable approach, as surely one or the other is going to become the focus of customer interest. We shall see how the place develops.

Overall, we said: "So Nemrut served us pretty nicely. At this stage, I'm not sure whether their custom is favouring the Turkish or British side of the menu, so it will be interesting to see how the emphasis of their menu develops. They have plans to run an evening menu focussing on Turkish seafood, so I'm certainly looking forward to that. For sure, it whet the appetite for my visit to Istanbul, next month."
One of the places I like to visit for breakfast or coffee with my friends. Today I got an interesting combination of scrambled eggs, Turkish salami (I hope it was), cheese, black and green olives on cucumber and tomato, white soft cheese, grilled baguette and Turkish tea. I agree that this place is lacking of identity however staff extremely friendly and overall experience very good. I will definitely be back for a quiet breakfast or lunch.
Had a quick dinner here a couple of weeks ago. Upon arrival I was the only customer and the place was still practically empty when I left but that I expect is down to a combination of it having only opened very recently and to the road outside being dug up.
Certainly the service I received was good and the homemade lentil soup and the falafel salad which followed were both tasty, filling and good value for money.
This is I think the only place of its sort that is open pretty late in the area and deserves to do well.
I love Turkish food and when done well is one of my favorite cuisines.  I have been to Istanbul and tried several restaurants and was blown away by their amazing food and ability to utilise every particle of selected meet and veg, so lets see if Truva is up for the challenge.

The breakfast I had here today was very tasty but when it comes to representation and the first saliva creating effect of impression it didn't hit high score. I have worked as a chef de partie years ago and easily spot when something has been microwaved and sadly those dry crunchy micro beams was all over the edges of the turkish sausage. Other then that it was really good food and looking at the kitchen they are equipped for greater cooking, so maybe the musakka will be a surprise? Will try one day.

Decor is beautiful with red walls and beautiful oriental lamps creating a relaxing atmosphere. I can imagine a great buzz here in evenings with turkish music and dance and hopefully this will happen soon :)

One point I'd have to mention is that I had a cotton mop string right next to my table, not too appetizing, other then this it looks clean, but I think they would have more customer if they had an eye for details like mop strings and didnt use microwaves for food, only a bad organised menu needs microwaves in my opinion.
We were in the area of Lauriston a couple of months ago and when we saw advertised the "Lahmacun" (or Turkish Pizza, - meat with dough) we had to try this as we were a) very peckish b) keen om Turkish Food c) our last visit here was at the opening of the cafe and we always said to return. So to make good on that promise we choose a table. The place is big. It wasn't busy so plenty of space.

The waitress was lovely and made some recommendations for us to order with the Lahmacun. Which was very filling but not as spicy as I was made to believe. I thin this is because Scottish/British people do not tend to eat spicy and they try to cater for that. Shame cause it was very very tasty! 
I understood that they were trying the dish out for inclusion into the menu - and offered it as a special. They even explained how it was made.
I think they should put in the menu as it is a great dish and especially around the art college with all the students they would do a good trade! 

We had a nice meal and when in the are we will certainly put this on our possible places to eat / snack.
Showcasing an impressive open charcoal barbecue, Rodi has transformed what was previously a rather small corner chippy into an excellent new Turkish restaurant, with room for around 30 diners.

I've eaten a fair amount of Turkish food, over the years, particularly on my regular jaunts to Istanbul. The food on offer here compared very favourably, with their meat extremely tender, and the main course portion absolutely vast. As an illustration, I had no need of breakfast the next day after dining here, as I was still full. 

Overall, we said: "Rodi is a really welcome new addition to the dining circuit. Once they've grown in to their new premises a little more, I'm confident they will become a firm favourite with Edinburgh diners, as their food is delicious. I look forward to my next visit, and would strongly recommend that you pay it a visit."
Rodi to me feels like what I would expect to find if I was given a really good Turkish home cooked meal.

There certainly no pretence to the food here its good honest and very tasty.

For my starter I went for the Sucuk - a heavily spiced beef sausage that was served with salad. One thing you notice in this place is the intoxicating wafts coming from the grill - having been hungry on arrival by the time my starter arrived I was pretty much drooling. The sausage was delicious, served on a small salad and with some bread on the table it didn't need anything else. This was a sausage celebration. Huzzah to the humble banger!

For my main I opted for the lamb spare ribs, served with rice and pida ( a really nice flatbread) as well as the various salads they brought to the table. Of the salads I really liked the charred onions with pomegranate - as Blythe.R said they are intense....I like intense.

The ribs were meaty, flavoursome and plentiful....basically my ideal kind of plate. A few extra napkins would have been handy but I demolished the ribs in records time with a big smile on my face. Always a good sign.

All in all this is a surprising gem of a place! Rodi comes highly JD Recommended!
My bedroom when I was a young teen was blue and orange - walls, ceiling and carpet all deep royal blue; all furniture, skirting boards and door and window frames were the brightest bright orange. So in a way, walking into the orangey warmth of Rodi and enjoying its shots of deep blue felt a little bit like coming home.

The effect was enhanced by the friendly welcome of the staff, and of course of the lovely Yelpers gathered around the table. It felt like a family dinner in somebody's vibrant, exotic home.

Ahhh and what a dinner. The sucuk starter was blissful - chunks of spicy sausage on fresh crispy lettuce - I could eat that any day of the week and be completely happy. My main, a beautiful chicken affair, was tender, succulent, flavoursome and seriously bountiful. My mighty appetite faltered and failed me in the face of such plenty... But not so much as to eschew the offer of rice pudding for dessert.

You all know about compartments, right? How the stomach totally has a savoury compartment and a pudding compartment? Well that's what was going on here. I was completely full in my main compartment but plenty of room for a bit of pudding.

The rice pudding surprised me as it was cold - but I liked it a lot; rich and creamy, it was a lovely new way for me to try it. The top was burnt - I think it was meant to be that way and I could see how it was supposed to work, to give a sharper kick to the sweet pudding, but it didn't quite go, for me. I ended up scooping out from underneath.

Aside from the front door, which had a tendency to stick open and let in the cold when someone entered or exited and meant that the staff frequently had to scoot over and close it (something they were always very prompt in doing) the restaurant is a lovely place. I imagine its location opposite the EICC will mean it's rarely short of business, especially in August. And if that means that Rodi continues for a long time to come, that can only be a good thing, because I definitely want to come back. Lots of times.
the monthly yelp dinner to try out new and exciting restaurants is always good fun, especially this months visit to Rodi.  this restaurant is a far venture from my usual side of town so probably some place i would have never visited had it not been for Blythe R's suggestion.  after a rather lengthy bus ride to the side of town followed by a very chilly walk past the EICC i spotted a glowing beacon of turkish food that was filled with fellow yelpers, warm bright colours, and the delicious smelling of grilled meats!

there were a good number of us and as in my usual style i was last to arrive.  however, i didn't need long to contemplate the menu and was quite happy to order when the waitress returned with my turkish tea.  i went for a starter of hummous followed by a grilled chicken dish.  i'm not sure how discrimatory i can be toward hummous as i love it and have yet to find any that hasn't been to my taste.  i was given a suitable portion size served along a basket of warm flat bread for dipping.  my rumbling tummy was suitably pleased and i started looking forward to the main course.

dishes took a bit to arrive as it appears everything is cooked fresh after you order.  there is a massive charcoal fire behind the register which is both warm and cosy for a cold night but also the palce where they grill all their meat.  which dishes did start to arrive we were given a number of side salads and dips and finally plentiful dishes of grilled meats with rice!  my grilled chicken sat atop a smoked aubergine dip and was accompanied by a side of rice and grilled flat bread.  the portion was HUGE.  seriously HUGE.  even after a hard run i was barely able to eat half before i was totally defeated.  but portion size aside, the chicken and aubergine and rice was super super tasty and i was sad to think i couldn't eat every bite!  the chicken was tender and juicy, the aubergine dip had a really lovely creamy smokey taste that mixed so well with both the chicken and the rice.  the salad dishes on the side were a nice veggie accompainment but i struggled to have more than a few forkfuls of these.

so overall i really really enjoyed Rodi.  the food was excellent and in the future i'd likely get a main dish to share with someone!  the staff are super friendly and the only negative point i can see is its rather far distance from where i live or tend to go out.  however, i would this a great place to get some dinner before the many festival shows at the EICC.
